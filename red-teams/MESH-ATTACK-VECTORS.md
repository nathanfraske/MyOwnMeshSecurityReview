# MyOwnMesh hybrid-networking red-team catalog

Status: target conformance and source-audit catalog for the restored hybrid networking architecture.

This catalog supersedes architecture-dependent pass conditions that required every connector exchange to be a durable signed record, prohibited all transport allocation before Device authentication, or required durable route, path, negotiation-generation, or session-generation state.

The current-source findings remain source findings. Their target interpretation is updated to match [`../ARCHITECTURE.md`](../ARCHITECTURE.md).

## 1. Target security boundary

The target permits bounded useful networking work before endpoint admission:

```text
untrusted hint or typed transport signal
    -> bounded candidate, socket, relay, probe, and handshake work
```

The target forbids crossing the promotion boundary without every exact predicate:

```text
working channel
+ fresh mutual Device authentication
+ exact MeshContext binding
+ applicable Open or Closed policy
+ authenticated local principal
+ post-authentication resource reservation
+ fresh opaque SessionCapability
    -> AuthenticatedPeerSession
```

The target durable fact families are limited to long-lived semantic state such as Open participation, Closed governance, durable capability grants and revocations, and reviewed application contract facts. Ordinary candidates, route selection, path handoff, connectivity checks, relay allocation liveness, and packet flow are live connector state.

Signaling includes both durable semantic exchange and ephemeral transport control. Neither category carries ordinary application payload.

## 2. Evidence labels

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Source-confirmed | The accepting control flow is present in the pinned source and the named guard is absent on that path |
| Runtime-reproduced | The isolated harness produced the observation and retained its evidence |
| Target obligation | The restored architecture requires the test; implementation status is not asserted |
| Source behavior, conforming under bounds | The source behavior is allowed only if it stays inside the stated target boundary |
| Policy decision | The owner must select a measurable policy or value before numeric pass or fail |
| Hardened | The repair and its positive and negative controls pass against the same reproduction |

## 3. Harness isolation

Every reproduction must:

1. use an approved sandbox, loopback-only process, or isolated virtual network;
2. use fresh temporary identities, mesh contexts, stores, ports, and process directories;
3. avoid production identities, sockets, services, and credentials;
4. record source commit, build features, dependency checksums, exact command line, process IDs, addresses, ports, and selected resource limits;
5. impose wall-clock, process, memory, file, queue, and network limits;
6. terminate and verify every child process;
7. retain redacted positive controls, inputs, outputs, resource samples, and cleanup evidence.

No case may target a public relay, production TURN service, production node, or another person's device.

## 4. Threat actors

The suite includes:

- an unauthenticated signaling sender;
- a fresh authentic Open identity;
- a fresh authentic key without Closed authorization;
- an admitted malicious endpoint;
- a carrier that drops, delays, reorders, duplicates, injects, replays, or censors;
- a malicious TURN, generic relay, or Closed member relay;
- a restrictive network;
- a malicious or unprivileged local application principal;
- identity rotation intended to bypass per-identity resource accounting;
- endpoint or connector callbacks delivered late or out of order.

Complete availability under total eclipse is not claimed.

## 5. Current-source finding reinterpretation

The source baseline and source evidence remain those recorded in the preceding catalog. The restored target classification is:

| ID | Source observation | Restored target interpretation | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| RTM-001 | Legacy shaped-topology code can route application payload through ordinary mesh members | Arc 03H moves the remaining source under the `legacy_v1` subtree and requires the `legacy-v1` feature plus deprecated, explicit `LegacyV1Runtime` and `LegacyV1Network` construction. Normal V4 source is checked with deprecated use denied. This is structural isolation, not a hard type-level exclusion proof. It remains open until Arc 12 deletes the frozen compatibility source | Critical |
| RTM-002 | Optional `RelayService` forwards application payload through an ordinary mesh member | Arc 03H keeps the service behind the same explicit LegacyV1 runtime and renames its source advertisement to `LegacyV1MemberRelay`. Normal V4 daemon startup and live reconfiguration reject it. It remains open until Arc 12 deletes the frozen compatibility source. Any application payload through a mesh member violates the endpoint-only data invariant | Critical |
| RTM-003 | Carrier input allocates transport before Device validation | Not automatically a defect. It fails only if work is unbounded, mutates durable authority, delivers application data, or promotes a session | High conditional |
| RTM-004 | Closed auto-approve admits a fresh unrostered key | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-005 | Directed application sends bypass admission | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-006 | Local roster mutation lacks proved principal and Closed authority | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-007 | Nostr origin is not bound to Device ID | Still a durable-authorship defect | Critical |
| RTM-008 | Nostr presence takeover creates victim Leave | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-009 | mDNS spoofs presence, Leave, and transport hints | Semantic spoofing and unbounded work are defects; bounded transport hints are allowed | High conditional |
| RTM-010 | Peer-wide Leave tears down a newer session | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-011 | Signaling has unbounded pre-upgrade and slow-consumer work | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-012 | Media transport objects exist before endpoint admission | Object creation is allowed under bounds; application delivery, outbound payload, or unbounded decode before promotion are defects | Critical conditional |
| RTM-013 | Governance signatures omit state-deriving context | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-014 | Concurrent governance delivery silently forks | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-015 | Split adoption does not prove derivation | Still a defect where such operation exists | High |
| RTM-016 | Governance persistence and anti-entropy are unbounded | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-017 | Reliable delivery permits unbounded peer keys and bytes | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-018 | Global queues and RPC work lack total bounds | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-019 | IPC routing labels are capabilities | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-020 | Required restrictive-network connector profiles are unsupported | Reachability gap against owner-selected requirements | High when required |
| RTM-021 | Adversarial TURN must not gain endpoint authority or plaintext | Target obligation | High |
| RTM-022 | Revocation, cleanup, crash, and effect races lack one model | Still a critical obligation | Critical |
| RTM-023 | Bounded negotiation begins without pair permission | Positive control, not a defect | None |
| RTM-024 | Replay after cache or deduplication eviction | Durable replay and live-capability non-revival remain obligations; old control may cause bounded candidate work | High |
| RTM-025 | Legacy state reconstructs connection policy | Persisted mesh authority must not choose application relationships; local connector policy is allowed | High |
| RTM-026 | Free-form negotiation fields carry application data | Still a defect | High |
| RTM-027 | Open authority survives migration into Closed | Still a defect | Critical |
| RTM-028 | Connected censoring relay suppresses fallback | Availability weakness; connector policy must not equate socket health with useful progress | High |
| RTM-029 | Carrier provenance is stripped | Still an availability and diagnostics weakness | High |

## 6. Superseded target assumptions

The restored target does not require:

```text
every offer, answer, or candidate to be a durable fact
durable PathOffer or PathAccept facts
a global PathID or current-path record
monotonic negotiation, session, relay, or path generations
a durable session anchor before transport work
common durable-fact validation before any candidate allocation
relay use only after exhaustive failure of all other candidates
relay-to-relay handoff signaling
```

Tests whose only failure condition is the absence of those constructs are removed or rewritten.

## 7. Durable semantic tests

### HYB-001. Canonical durable fact integrity

Alter every state-deriving durable field, Fact ID, author key, signature, mesh context, scope, predecessor set, and canonical encoding.

**Pass:** Only the exact canonical signed positive control reaches durable projection. Invalid input creates no accepted durable receipt, durable head, or durable effect.

### HYB-002. Carrier non-authorship

Deliver a valid A-authored fact through a B-controlled carrier and a B-authored carrier envelope that claims A.

**Pass:** The valid fact remains authored by A. The carrier claim grants no authorship.

### HYB-003. Open permissionless positive control

Have a fresh Device key publish valid self-authored Open participation.

**Pass:** It may project as an Open participant without sponsor, pair grant, identity vote, or application approval, subject only to protocol validation and local resource admission.

### HYB-004. Closed unauthorized key

Use a valid Device signature from a key absent from the accepted Closed governance state.

**Pass:** It cannot create Closed participation or promote a Closed session. Bounded harmless observation may occur only under the selected explicit rule.

### HYB-005. Durable concurrency classification

Create independent, joinable, and exclusive concurrent facts under the adopted domains.

**Pass:** Independent facts project independently, joinable facts satisfy the declared join, and exclusive same-cell siblings fail closed. Common ancestry alone does not create a fork.

### HYB-006. Durable compaction equivalence

Compare full-history and compacted-basis validation and projection for every covered future continuation.

**Pass:** Validation disposition and durable state are equivalent. Compaction does not affect live path or reachability state.

### HYB-007. Store opening

Open the same durable basis after normal restart, long storage, copy, and transport through different media.

**Pass:** Durable projection is identical. No candidate, socket, channel, key, replay window, observation, or session handle is restored.

### HYB-008. Open-to-Closed separation

Replay Open participation and application-like claims into a Closed context.

**Pass:** Only the selected Closed governance proof supplies Closed authority.

## 8. Signaling tests

### HYB-009. Durable and ephemeral parser separation

Send every durable fact to the ephemeral control parser and every ephemeral control message to the durable parser.

**Pass:** Cross-class inputs are rejected or treated as bounded unknown input. No parser retries an input under another semantic class after rejection.

### HYB-010. No application payload in signaling

Attempt to place a marked application byte string into every public durable and ephemeral signaling constructor, unknown field, extension map, padding field, candidate field, and relay-control field.

**Pass:** Ordinary application APIs cannot construct such messages. Unknown or opaque fields are rejected. A compromised endpoint's covert timing or valid-value channel is not represented as a supported payload path.

### HYB-011. Carrier-synthesized leave

Disconnect signaling carriers, remove mDNS advertisements, and send service-authored Leave messages.

**Pass:** Carrier events affect delivery and transport observations only. They cannot synthesize Open withdrawal, Closed removal, or session closure.

### HYB-012. Connected censoring carrier

Keep one signaling socket healthy while withholding required facts or transport-control responses.

**Pass:** Socket health alone is not reported as complete progress. Independent carriers may be attempted under owner policy. Total eclipse remains an availability limit.

### HYB-013. Provenance retention

Deliver the same durable fact and different dependency subsets through several carriers.

**Pass:** Durable state deduplicates by Fact ID while bounded local provenance remains distinguishable. Provenance does not vote.

## 9. Speculative transport tests

### HYB-014. Raw hint creates bounded candidate work

Supply raw mDNS, address, incoming socket, offer, candidate, and relay hints from unknown and unauthorized sources.

**Pass:** The runtime may create bounded candidates, sockets, relay allocations, or handshake state. It does not mutate durable authority, expose application data, or exceed pre-authentication budgets.

### HYB-015. Identity-rotation resource attack

Use many fresh keys and unauthenticated hints to create candidate work.

**Pass:** Global limits dominate per-identity limits. Cleanup returns the runtime below the selected steady-state bound.

### HYB-016. Candidate racing

Make direct, TURN, generic relay, and Closed member-relay candidates complete in different orders and with different quality.

**Pass:** The connector may use the first or locally preferred promotable channel. No durable route record or exhaustive-failure proof is required.

### HYB-017. Restrictive-network matrix

Exercise every owner-required egress profile.

**Pass:** A supported connector establishes a promotable channel or returns a bounded typed no-path result. Signaling success is not reported as a data path.

### HYB-018. Pre-authentication real-time flow quarantine

Establish connector-native real-time transport objects and send valid-rate and over-rate encoded units before Device authentication and promotion.

**Pass:** No unit reaches the application and no outbound application unit is sent. Pre-authentication parse, buffer, decode, and task work remain within selected bounds. Track or receiver setup alone is not a failure.

### HYB-018A. Media-profile confinement

Inventory every core, connector, application, daemon, and IPC type that names video, audio, H.264, Opus, screen, camera, microphone, lane count, lane number, or track purpose. Exercise one data-only connector and the WebRTC real-time flow provider.

**Pass:** Codec and media-purpose semantics are absent from durable authority, signaling authority, endpoint authentication, and channel promotion. The WebRTC connector may retain native RTP/RTCP mechanics and connector-local lane policy. Applications receive encoded real-time units only through a live session capability. A connector without the real-time flow extension remains conforming.

### HYB-019. Candidate callback after replacement

Delay callbacks from a destroyed candidate or channel until a replacement exists.

**Pass:** Exact local capability mismatch prevents the old callback from mutating the replacement.

## 10. Channel-promotion tests

### HYB-020. Promotion predicate matrix

Independently omit or alter:

- working channel state;
- local and remote Device identities;
- endpoint-authentication transcript;
- channel binding;
- MeshContext;
- Open or Closed policy;
- local principal;
- post-authentication reservation;
- fresh session capability.

**Pass:** Session exposure occurs only when every exact predicate holds.

### HYB-021. Working socket is not authority

Complete TCP, QUIC, ICE, DTLS, TURN, or relay setup without MyOwnMesh endpoint authentication.

**Pass:** No authenticated peer-session handle or application delivery occurs.

### HYB-022. Claimed Device mismatch

Begin from a hint claiming Device C but authenticate Device D on the channel.

**Pass:** The attempt fails for C. It may be reclassified as D only through an explicit policy path that does not smuggle the original claim into authority.

### HYB-023. Cross-channel transcript replay

Record a valid endpoint-authentication transcript on channel X and replay it on channel Y.

**Pass:** Channel binding and freshness reject it.

### HYB-024. Restart non-revival

Persist all allowed durable state, restart, and replay old signaling and transport-control bytes.

**Pass:** No old candidate, channel, traffic key, replay state, principal capability, or session handle is reconstructed.

### HYB-025. Directed application send before promotion

Exercise messages, RPC, media, datagrams, and every application send API in every pre-promotion state.

**Pass:** No application bytes reach the remote or local application consumer.

### HYB-026. Current policy loss

After promotion, accept an applicable Open withdrawal or Closed removal and race it against queued sends and callbacks.

**Pass:** New protected use fails after the committed policy change. Cleanup remains possible. A later re-add or re-presentation requires a newly valid session promotion, not revival of the old handle.

## 11. Relay tests

### HYB-027. Adversarial TURN and generic relay

Drop, delay, duplicate, reorder, truncate, and modify endpoint ciphertext. Attempt endpoint substitution.

**Pass:** Relay denial and metadata visibility are allowed residuals. Relay cannot become A or C, change accepted plaintext, or obtain application plaintext.

### HYB-028. Closed member relay positive control

Authorize B under the selected Closed profile. Establish A-C through B.

**Pass:** B is visibly identified, forwards only opaque A-C packets for one bounded allocation, and never becomes the application endpoint.

### HYB-029. Anonymous relay credential rejection

Offer a relay credential proving only that some member is authorized without identifying B.

**Pass:** The basal Closed member-relay profile rejects it.

### HYB-030. Exact relay destination

Attempt to change C, add fanout, supply arbitrary host or port per packet, or recursively forward through another relay.

**Pass:** The allocation is confined to exact A-C endpoint packets and finite resources.

### HYB-031. Relay use without exhaustive candidate failure

Race a valid relay against a slow direct path.

**Pass:** Relay use is permitted by local policy without a signed or durable exhaustion proof.

## 12. Handoff and replay tests

### HYB-032. Endpoint-driven B-to-D handoff

Use B, then establish D while B remains active.

**Pass:** A and C authenticate D's channel and may use `{B, D}` before selecting D. No B-D signaling is required.

### HYB-033. Forged switch request

Have B, D, or a signaling carrier send `switch now`, `current route`, or equivalent messages.

**Pass:** No such message directly changes the authenticated channel set or local selected carrier.

### HYB-034. Forced old-path failure

Drop all B traffic while advertising D.

**Pass:** Failure may trigger candidate work or selection of an already authenticated D channel. It cannot promote unauthenticated D.

### HYB-035. Old-channel packet replay on new channel

Replay B-channel packets and endpoint-authentication messages through D.

**Pass:** Channel-specific keys, binding, and replay state reject them.

### HYB-036. Delayed old-channel close

Deliver a late B close or failure callback after D is active.

**Pass:** It affects only B's exact local channel capability and cannot close D or the peer session unless no authenticated channel remains and policy closes the session.

### HYB-037. Concurrent bidirectional carrier choice

Let A temporarily send over D while C still sends over B.

**Pass:** Both directions remain secure when each used channel is independently authenticated. No global simultaneous switch is required.

## 13. Signaling and payload boundary tests

### HYB-038. Cross-protocol listener confusion

Co-locate signaling, TURN, generic relay, Closed member relay, and application service endpoints. Send each message type to every wrong listener.

**Pass:** No cross-parser or cross-effect substitution occurs. Co-location claims no physical compromise isolation that deployment does not provide.

### HYB-039. Ordinary member forwarding

Establish A-B and B-C sessions but no A-C session. Ask A to send application data to C through ordinary mesh APIs.

**Pass:** No implicit forwarding occurs. A-C requires its own promoted session or an explicit application intermediary.

### HYB-040. Explicit application intermediary positive control

Make B an application endpoint for A-B and B-C.

**Pass:** B may process and reauthor application operations under application policy. The system reports two sessions, not a transparent carrier.

## 14. Reachability tests

### HYB-041. Presence is not path

Receive a fresh signed presence response while every data connector fails.

**Pass:** Reachability view shows the exact evidence classes and returns no viable peer transport.

### HYB-042. Path is not durable participation

Keep a working authenticated channel while delivering a durable withdrawal or Closed removal.

**Pass:** The transport may physically exist, but application use follows the current policy guard. Transport existence does not rewrite durable state.

### HYB-043. Local freshness

Replay old observations with fresh remote or carrier timestamps.

**Pass:** Local age remains based on the original local verification time.

## 15. Resource and crash tests

### HYB-044. Pre-authentication guard ordering

Deny each reservation before its protected parser, candidate, socket, relay, handshake, media quarantine, timer, task, or queue allocation.

**Pass:** No protected allocation occurs first.

### HYB-045. Post-authentication guard ordering

Allow a working authenticated channel but deny session, application queue, media, or handle resources one at a time.

**Pass:** Promotion or the protected operation fails without leaking application data.

### HYB-046. Crash around promotion

Crash before and after endpoint authentication, reservation, handle commit, and application notification.

**Pass:** Recovery exposes either no session or one complete valid session state. No partial handle or duplicated semantic exposure exists.

### HYB-047. Crash around external effects

Crash after an external transport or signaling action but before effect completion commit.

**Pass:** Deterministic effect identity and adapter idempotency prevent duplicate semantic effects. Cleanup remains possible.

### HYB-048. Complete eclipse control

Run identical local traces where a newer durable fact or better path exists but is withheld, and where it does not exist.

**Pass:** The runtime does not falsely claim to distinguish the worlds. It still rejects forged authority and unauthenticated sessions.

## 16. Cross-case proof obligations

A conformance claim must also show:

1. every public parser and constructor maps to one closed accepted type;
2. every state mutation has one owning component;
3. every external effect is reachable only through a committed guarded plan;
4. pre-authentication work cannot reach application delivery;
5. channel promotion has no alternate bypass path;
6. carrier identity never substitutes for Device identity or Closed authority;
7. no durable path ledger or monotonic path/session generation remains a basal dependency;
8. durable `Project` excludes live transport observations;
9. application payload cannot reach durable or ephemeral signaling constructors;
10. relays have exact destinations and finite resources;
11. delayed callbacks and stale local capabilities are rejected;
12. store opening reconstructs no live networking authority;
13. every numeric bound is measured and owner-approved.

## 17. Evidence bundle

Each completed runtime case retains:

```text
case.json
commands.txt
processes.txt
ports.txt
inputs/
state-before.json
state-after.json
events.jsonl
stdout.log
stderr.log
resource-samples.csv
result.md
```

`result.md` states reproduced, not reproduced, blocked by harness defect, source precondition false, or fixed with repair and negative-control evidence.
