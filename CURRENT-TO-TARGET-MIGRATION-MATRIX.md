# V4 architecture ownership matrix

Status: final ownership map for the adopted hybrid architecture of
`mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh`.

The paths below identify source families and their final owners. Source
references provide provenance; execution, audit, and platform evidence are
separate and are never inferred from an ownership declaration.

## Implemented canonical authority boundary

V4 durable authority is the semantic `FactGraph`, persisted by
`DurableSemanticStore`, and composed of verified `SignedFact` records.
`FactBody::RoleGrant`, `FactBody::RoleRevoke`, and `FactBody::Evict` are
the exact ordinary governance facts. `NetworkCmd::ProposeRoleGrant`,
`NetworkCmd::ProposeRoleRevoke`, and `NetworkCmd::ProposeEvict` are typed
authoring requests that must pass semantic verification; they are not an
alternate authority store. Same-cell `FactBody::Resolution` and cross-cell
`FactBody::AuthorityLineageResolution` remain distinct typed selectors.

`NetworkKind` is configuration/profile shape, while topology and mesh
context are outside ordinary fact authority. Roster and peer-registry data
are non-authoritative projections. The former `NetworkState` transition,
quorum, split, and serialized-roster authority model is removed and cannot
authorize a session, membership change, or application operation.

The sole bounded exception to ordinary plaintext-forwarding restrictions is
the explicit Closed-member opaque relay. A-B and B-C are independently
authenticated and promoted before A sends `Open`, B sends `Offer`, and C
sends `Accept`. Endpoint sessions seal/open plaintext; B forwards only opaque
packets under the complete route and exact live allocation generation. The
provider-backed two-direction queues, pending handshake custody, retained
packets, and cleanup are finite under the Closed-relay profile. Admission
refusal preserves pending custody. Generation tombstones make duplicate
terminal closes idempotent and prevent delayed predecessor controls from
affecting successors. Shutdown wakes bounded waiters, settles endpoint,
accepted, pending, closing, and allocation custody, and joins owned tasks.

| Source path or subsystem | Owned capability | Final owner | Final disposition | Invariant |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `crates/myownmesh-core/src/identity.rs` | Device key and Device ID implementation | Identity foundation | Canonical identity implementation | All identity use goes through one typed API |
| `signing.rs` | Domain-separated Ed25519 signing helpers | Durable semantics and Endpoint Auth, separately | Split by protocol domain; do not create a generic signer service | No cross-domain signing call accepts an arbitrary domain string from a caller |
| `verification.rs` | Human verification code UX | Application/Endpoint Auth presentation | Presentation-only surface | No authorization predicate depends on the code |
| `roster.rs` | Non-authoritative display/projection shape | Semantic projection only | Projection-only data required by callers | Open and Closed projections come only from verified semantic facts |
| `network_state.rs` | None from the legacy authority model | Excluded legacy authority | No transition/quorum/split/serialized-roster authority | No legacy field authorizes a session, member, or application operation |
| `protocol/mod.rs` and submodules | Wire framing needed by typed lanes | Separate typed lanes | Keep only durable exchange, ephemeral transport control, endpoint/session control, and application frames | One global wire enum supplies no cross-lane dispatch authority |
| `topology/` | Useful connection preference algorithms | Connector/local policy | Demote to optional local connection-selection policy | Topology never grants authority or creates ordinary forwarding |
| `transport/webrtc.rs` | WebRTC, ICE, DTLS, native RTP/RTCP tracks, transport callbacks | WebRTC Connector Worker plus optional WebRTC Real-time Flow Provider | Wrap first, then split channel and flow boundaries | Connector produces `ConnectedChannelCapability`; flow provider is usable only through a promoted session |
| `MediaLaneOpen` / `MediaLaneClose` commands | Application-facing lane lifecycle mixed into `NetworkCmd` | Realtime flow operations on `JoinedNetwork` | Absent from the global engine command surface | Realtime flow lifecycle is owned by `JoinedNetwork` |
| `LaneKind`, `VideoSample`, `AudioSample`, H.264 and Opus constants | Codec and media-purpose semantics inside core transport types | Application-supplied realtime profile; WebRTC-specific encoded-flow adapter | Core does not own codec or screen/camera/audio meaning | Encoded flow lifecycle is separate from application media semantics |
| `MEDIA_LANES`, pre-provisioning, drain grace, m-line reuse | WebRTC performance and lifecycle policy | WebRTC Real-time Flow Provider | Shared application-stated flow ceiling | Other connectors need not implement WebRTC lane policy |
| `engine/mod.rs` driver | Serial runtime orchestration | Runtime supervisor | Runtime orchestration only; governance uses exact typed requests | No legacy state class remains an authority owner |
| `engine/state.rs` / `NetworkState` / `NetworkCmd` | Runtime coordination only | Runtime supervisor plus DurableSemanticStore/FactGraph | Runtime coordination is separate from semantic authority; governance uses exact typed ProposeRoleGrant/ProposeRoleRevoke/ProposeEvict requests | No runtime snapshot/quorum field is an authority source |
| `engine/connection.rs` | Per-peer transport bookkeeping | Attempt Node and Peer Session Node | Split pre-auth and post-auth state | No object simultaneously owns candidate and application-session authority |
| `engine/handshake.rs` | Channel-bound mutual Device authentication and approval timing | Endpoint Auth Task and Session Broker | The live `Hello`/`AuthResponse` path signs and verifies the sole `endpoint_auth` transcript; `accept_peer_proof` is the sole promotion transition. Mesh-policy decisions remain outside the proof. No execution or audit result is inferred here. | Authenticated channel and policy promotion are separate typed transitions |
| `engine/heartbeat.rs` | Inbound-traffic liveness evidence | Peer Session and Reachability Nodes | Local reachability evidence | No heartbeat result mutates durable participation |
| `engine/ice_watchdog.rs` | ICE restart behavior | WebRTC Connector / Peer Session recovery | Connector/session recovery policy | Recovery operates on live channels, not durable route state |
| `engine/network_watch.rs` | OS network-change recovery | Connector runtime | Bounded connector recovery | Network changes cause bounded recovery only |
| `engine/ladder.rs` | Cheapest-to-most-disruptive recovery ordering | Peer Session recovery policy | Local recovery policy without authority semantics | Every tier acts only on authenticated/live transport objects |
| `engine/wake.rs` | Resume detection | Reachability and Peer Session recovery | Reachability/session signal | Wake never synthesizes leave or roster changes |
| `engine/reconcile.rs` | Config-triggered restart behavior | Runtime Supervisor and Connector Node | Split by owned configuration | No global stop/start is used for an unrelated local change |
| `engine/reliable.rs` | Delivery semantics and retransmission experience | Application session data service | Session-capability-bound delivery | Unknown peer strings cannot create unbounded durable outboxes |
| `engine/routing.rs` | Failure reproductions only | No final owner | Ordinary member forwarding is absent | No ordinary forwarding authority exists |
| `engine/signaling_bridge.rs` | Existing Nostr/mDNS fan-in/out and dedup | Signaling Node | Typed ports with retained provenance | Durable and ephemeral lanes are classified before domain parsing |
| `engine/governance.rs` | Governance interaction workflows and tests | Closed Semantic Node | Author and verify canonical RoleGrant/RoleRevoke/Evict facts and typed lineage selectors | Closed projection is pure; policy guards consume verified FactGraph state |
| `engine/traffic.rs` | Traffic counters and observations | Reachability / diagnostics | Retain only as local evidence | No counter is an authorization input |
| `engine/scheduler.rs`, `tick.rs` | Named timer behavior and operational tuning | Owning nodes | Partition timers by owner | No global ticker mutates unrelated state |
| `channels.rs` | Typed pub/sub API | Application facade over Peer Session | Public typed channel surface with live session capability internally | All sends and deliveries cross promotion boundary |
| `rpc.rs` | RPC API and streaming behavior | Application facade over Peer Session | Public RPC surface with bounded tasks and queues | No RPC is dispatched pre-promotion |
| `handle.rs` | `Mesh`, `JoinedNetwork`, and embedder API | Application Gateway facade | Public gateway surface over typed capabilities | Public IDs are not internal capabilities |
| `events.rs` | Diagnostics and embedder events | Narrow node event DTOs | Node-scoped diagnostic DTOs | No global event enum authorizes another subsystem |
| `engine/closed_relay.rs` plus runtime relay | Closed-member opaque relay | Exact Closed Relay Node | Explicit A-B/B-C promotion, route-bound controls, provider-backed directional opaque allocation, and generation-safe terminal custody | Relay has finite exact allocation, no endpoint key material, and no application parsing |
| `myownmesh-signaling` Nostr driver | Production signaling carrier and reconnect knowledge | Signaling Adapter | Typed signaling lane with bounded provider-backed delivery | Carrier identity never becomes Device authority |
| `myownmesh-signaling` mDNS driver | LAN discovery and local signaling | Discovery/Signaling Adapter | Bounded hints and typed control exchange | Withdrawal cannot synthesize durable leave |
| `LocalBroker` | Deterministic in-process transport | Test and local signaling adapter | Retain | Same typed-lane behavior as network adapters |
| `myownmesh-signaling` server | Self-hosted signaling | Signaling service | Bounded signaling service without semantic leave synthesis | Socket lifecycle affects only carrier observations |
| `myownmesh-services` STUN/TURN | Working infrastructure | Connector infrastructure | Infrastructure service | Service cannot become Device or application authority |
| daemon control socket | Deployment and administration surface | Application Gateway / local-principal boundary | Authenticated local-principal transport | Every privileged operation uses an authenticated principal capability |
| GUI | Existing operator UX | Application client | Client of the application gateway | GUI never constructs raw signaling or authority proofs |
| updater, installer, service manager, release packaging | Operational product infrastructure | Existing operational crates | Operational infrastructure | Deployment lifecycle remains separate from mesh authority |

## Executable production migration contract

The architecture is exercised through public production process and control
boundaries, not by a second architecture embedded in a fixture. The maintained
full-process entry point is [`scripts/run-production-e2e.py`](scripts/run-production-e2e.py).
It intentionally covers one finite path; other advertised carriers and platform
profiles retain their own qualification matrices.

| Sequence | Current production entry or owner | Target contract exercised by the runner | Harness observation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1. Admit two processes | `crates/myownmesh/src/main.rs` -> `cli/serve.rs` | two isolated daemon owners, each supplied the complete finite `MYOWNMESH_RESOURCE_GRANT` and explicit connector realtime policy | control `status` answers from both exact local-principal sockets |
| 2. Discover and exchange control | `myownmesh-signaling/src/mdns/driver.rs` plus selected discovery backend; `engine/signaling_bridge.rs` | typed LAN signaling only; no Nostr, `LocalBroker`, public STUN, or TURN substitute | daemon logs and the peer snapshots retained after both peers are sighted |
| 3. Construct a channel | `engine/connection.rs`, `transport/ice.rs`, `transport/webrtc.rs` | bounded production ICE/WebRTC connector work creates the channel that actually carries the proof | each peer snapshot retains its selected candidate pair |
| 4. Authenticate and promote | `endpoint_auth/{task,transcript}.rs`, `engine/handshake.rs`, `runtime/session_broker/mod.rs` | fresh channel-bound Device proof followed by bilateral Open auto-approval and exact current-session promotion | both snapshots report the opposite Device as authenticated and `active` |
| 5. Bind the local consumer | `control.rs`, `ipc/clients.rs`, `control/dispatch/channel.rs` | an `EventsSubscribe` capability owns B's exact channel subscription | subscription acknowledgement is consumed in memory; its bearer capability is not persisted |
| 6. Deliver application data | `application_gateway/channels.rs`, `ipc/bridge.rs` | A uses `ChannelSendReliable`; B receives the exact `ChannelInbound` frame through its promoted session | redacted request response, B event JSONL, and exact token match |
| 7. Settle owners | daemon shutdown plus connector/session/control owners | event socket closes; both daemon process groups receive bounded graceful shutdown and every registered connector/session/control owner reaches its join boundary | both processes report `forced: false` and `returncode: 0` in the neutral run manifest; the child-only kill backstop is cleanup-only and fails the contract if used |

A zero harness exit states only that this executable contract reached its
declared terminal. It is not, by itself, a platform, performance, packaging, or
release claim. The harness never manufactures resource amounts, installs a
dependency, builds a binary, edits a user's normal home, or deletes the
preserved run directory.
