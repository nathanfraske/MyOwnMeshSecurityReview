//! Self-hosted STUN / TURN servers for MyOwnMesh.
//!
//! These let a device become an ICE infrastructure provider for the
//! rest of the mesh: a [`stun::StunServer`] answers RFC 5389 Binding
//! requests so peers can learn their reflexive address without a public
//! provider, and a [`turn::TurnServer`] relays media / data via RFC 5766
//! allocations for peers stuck behind symmetric NAT. Together with the
//! self-hosted signaling relay in `myownmesh-signaling::server`, they
//! make a fully internet-isolated network practical — no Google STUN,
//! no Cloudflare TURN, no public Nostr relay required.
//!
//! Both servers are thin, async wrappers over the webrtc-rs `stun` /
//! `turn` crates (the same versions the mesh transport already links),
//! driven by the [`myownmesh_core::config`] service config. They live in
//! their own crate so embedders that only want the mesh runtime don't
//! pull the TURN server's dependency tree.
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # async fn _ex() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! use myownmesh_services::{StunServer, TurnServer};
//! use myownmesh_core::config::{StunServiceConfig, TurnServiceConfig};
//!
//! # let scope: myownmesh_core::LocalApplicationResourceScope = todo!();
//! let stun = StunServer::start_with_resource_scope(
//!     &StunServiceConfig { enabled: true, ..Default::default() },
//!     scope,
//! ).await?;
//! println!("STUN listening on {}", stun.local_addr());
//! # let _ = stun;
//! # Ok(()) }
//! ```
