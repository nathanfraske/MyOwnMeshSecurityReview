//! Regression test for **MOM-01**: closed-network roster membership may
//! only be expanded by an authority (Controller/Owner).
//!
//! Before the fix, `governance::on_roster_entries` added any device id a
//! peer gossiped to the local roster regardless of the network kind or the
//! sender's authority. Because a rostered peer is auto-approved on every
//! future connection (`auto = cfg.auto_approve || rostered`), an attacker
//! who cleared a single approval — or any plain Member — could conscript
//! arbitrary identities into a *closed* network and have them auto-approved
//! network-wide.
//!
//! The fix makes closed-network membership owner-**signed**: it rides the
//! signed transition log (a ratified `RoleGrant`), and the unsigned
//! roster-entry gossip is never a trust input on a closed network — not even
//! from a Controller/Owner. Authority over the *messenger* is not authority
//! over the *data*: the membership data itself must be signed by an authority.
//! Open networks stay permissionless by design (a member is anyone any current
//! member has vouched for).
//!
//! The test drives `on_roster_entries` directly against a closed-network
//! state set up in-process — no transport/handshake timing — so the
//! authority gate is exercised deterministically.
//!
//! Companion to `roster_gossip.rs` (open-network convergence) and
//! `closed_network_governance.rs` (signed transitions).
