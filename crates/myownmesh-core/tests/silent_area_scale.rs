//! A silent area at scale, measured: one operator node and N member
//! boxes on a **Silent** mesh, over the real engine + WebRTC transport
//! (in-process `LocalBroker` signaling, loopback ICE). This is the
//! hub-and-quiet-spokes shape any embedder builds a help desk, kiosk
//! fleet, or appliance estate on.
//!
//! Asserts the Silent contract end to end:
//!   * members DISCOVER nothing actionable — they sit Sighted-only,
//!     never authenticate to anyone on their own, and never see each
//!     other;
//!   * every member still surfaces to the operator (presence), and a
//!     deliberate `connect_peer` from the operator — and only that —
//!     brings a session up;
//!   * after N sessions, each member is connected to exactly one peer:
//!     the operator. No spoke↔spoke sessions exist.
//!
//! And measures what the user actually feels:
//!   * discovery time (attach → the operator sees all N),
//!   * deliberate-dial latency (connect_peer → both sides authenticated),
//!   * app-frame round trip through the established session,
//!
//! printed as p50/p95/max with the per-lane traffic counters, so two
//! builds (or two topologies) can be compared honestly:
//!
//! ```text
