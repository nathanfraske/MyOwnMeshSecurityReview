//! Typed publish/subscribe channels between peers.
//!
//! Embedders register a [`Channel`] by name; both ends use the
//! same name to bind their senders to their receivers. Messages
//! are serialized as JSON on the wire (the
//! [`crate::protocol::MeshMessage::Channel`] variant carries the
//! channel name + JSON payload), so any `Serialize +
//! DeserializeOwned` type works.
//!
//! Delivery is best-effort: if no peer with the named channel is
//! connected, the send still succeeds but reaches nobody. The
//! engine's per-peer queue applies its own backpressure; the
//! channel layer never holds bytes for a peer that isn't yet up.
