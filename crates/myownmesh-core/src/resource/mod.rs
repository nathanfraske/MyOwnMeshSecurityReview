//! Resource ownership and observation for the V4 transition.
//!
//! The provider submodule grants finite resource leases. The existing
//! accountant below remains observation-only and cannot authorize work.
//! Keeping those roles distinct prevents measurements from becoming permits.
//!
//! The queue and map submodules are containers built on those leases rather
//! than a second kind of permit: they store what an owner already paid for, one
//! funded allocation per entry, and they grant nothing of their own. Both exist
//! because the standard collections cannot state an entry's cost — a ring's
//! spare capacity belongs to no entry, and a B-tree's node belongs to several —
//! so an owner using one can charge per entry or release per entry, but not
//! both truthfully.
