//! An ordered map in which every entry owns exactly one allocation and pays for
//! exactly that allocation.
//!
//! **Why not `BTreeMap`.** A B-tree entry does not own an allocation. Several
//! entries share a node, and the node is freed only when it empties, so an
//! owner charging per entry and releasing per removal releases memory the
//! allocator still holds: a map that fills and drains gives back everything it
//! claimed while the nodes are still there. The bytes of a slot are real, but
//! the *allocation* term cannot be released at the moment an entry leaves,
//! because nothing about that moment says whether an allocation left with it.
//!
//! **Why not a sorted `Vec` either.** That makes the collection's capacity
//! exact, which is a different thing from making an entry's cost exact: the
//! buffer and its slack survive every removal, so no entry can release its own
//! share, and the shift on each insert and remove is linear in the session's
//! own size — which an adversary chooses.
//!
//! **A treap.** One `Box` per entry, so `size_of::<LeasedMapNode<K, V>>()` is
//! the allocation and there is no spare capacity anywhere. Ordered by key for
//! lookup, heap-ordered by a priority derived from hashing the key, which keeps
//! the expected depth logarithmic without any rebalancing that allocates.
//! Insertion and removal move nodes by rotation and allocate nothing beyond the
//! one node being added.
//!
//! **The priority is not identity and not authority.** It is a balancing detail
//! and nothing reads it but the rotations below. It is derived per map from a
//! [`std::collections::hash_map::RandomState`], so it is unpredictable across
//! processes and a peer choosing names cannot choose a shape.
