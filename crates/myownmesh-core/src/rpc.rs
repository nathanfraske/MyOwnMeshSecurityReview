//! Generic request/response RPC over the mesh data channels.
//!
//! Embedders register a handler by `method` name; callers invoke
//! it on a peer via [`Rpc::call`]. Single-shot responses use a
//! `oneshot` round-trip; streaming responses use
//! `tokio::sync::mpsc` plus the
//! [`crate::protocol::rpc::RpcStreamChunkMessage`] /
//! [`crate::protocol::rpc::RpcStreamEndMessage`] frames so a
//! single request can yield many ordered chunks.
//!
//! In-flight requests are fields of the exact promoted peer session that sent
//! them. Each retained record and queued stream item holds its provider lease;
//! replacement, revocation and shutdown drop that session record and resolve
//! its callers.
//!
//! A request id is a routing key, never an authority. Every entry
//! is only looked up after the admitted inbound dispatch has re-entered the
//! captured installation's session record. A replacement connector therefore
//! has no map in which the predecessor's request can exist.
//!
//! Locally the same holds one level finer. Filing an operation also
//! hands its caller a process-local identity for the exact entry it
//! filed, and a caller withdrawing an entry after a failed send
//! matches on that identity rather than on the key and binding,
//! which a recycled id could reproduce exactly. Nothing inbound is
//! ever matched against it.

    /// An oversized payload is refused, and refused **for its size**.

    /// control used to assert the refusal alone, against a fixture whose grant
    /// named no `QueuedBytes` at all: a five-byte payload was refused there for
    /// exactly the same reason a sixteen-mebibyte one was, so it passed while
    /// proving nothing about pressure. It would have kept passing under any
    /// repair.
    ///
    /// So: a small payload must be admitted first, from the same session and
    /// the same funded fixture, and a second small payload must still be
    /// admitted *after* the refusal. The first rules out a grant that funds no
    /// retention; the second rules out a grant whose last slot the first push
    /// consumed — the only two ways this refusal could be about something other
    /// than the payload's size. The fixture funds exactly two retained items
    /// (`FIXTURE_STREAM_ITEMS`), which is what leaves the second push room.
    ///
    /// The refusal is asserted **by kind**, not merely as a failure. `push`
    /// answers `Pressure` and `Malformed` separately, and only `Pressure` says
    /// what this control is named for; asserting the negation alone would keep
    /// passing if an oversized payload started being reported as unrepresentable
    /// instead of unfunded.
