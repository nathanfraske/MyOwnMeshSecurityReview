//! Frozen LegacyV1 roster-gated application frame relay.
//!
//! It forwards [`RelayEnvelope`] frames it receives on [`RELAY_CHANNEL`]
//! to other roster members, so peers that can each reach the relay but
//! not each other can still exchange messages. The device becomes a
//! router, ingress, and egress hub for the network.
//!
//! The forwarder uses nothing beyond the core channel + roster + peer
//! snapshot APIs, so it lives in core and any embedder can host a relay
//! by constructing a [`RelayService`] over a joined network's state.
//! The daemon does exactly that for every joined network when
//! `services.relay.enabled` is set.
//!
//! Trust: forwarding is roster-gated on *both* ends. A frame is only
//! relayed when its sender is an approved peer of this device, and a
//! directed frame only reaches its destination when that destination is
//! also approved. The relay never forwards for or to strangers, and it
//! stamps the authenticated sender id into the forwarded envelope so the
//! recipient can trust the `src` field rather than the wire claim.
//!
//! Corrected LegacyV1 rejects the historical topology-routing wrapper at this
//! boundary. That wrapper used this same relay channel before routed and plain
//! relay ownership became disjoint. Apart from recognizing and rejecting that
//! exact wrapper shape, the relay treats application payload as opaque.
