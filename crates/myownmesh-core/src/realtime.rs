//! The **basal** realtime vocabulary: what is true of any flow, on any provider.
//!
//! A basal flow is a labelled, directed stream of opaque byte units inside a
//! session. Direction, refusal, and the lease on a session's inbound stream
//! need no clock, no codec and no transport to mean something.
//!
//! A flow ending is not among them, and that is a contract rather than an
//! omission. A close is the result of the local operation that performed it,
//! returned to that caller; a session ending is the inbound stream ending. So
//! there is nothing left for a lifecycle event to say that its reader was not
//! already told, and an event naming only a reusable name could not say it
//! unambiguously anyway.
//!
//! Anything that does — media kind, MIME, clock rate, channels, pacing
//! duration, RTP timestamp, marker — belongs to the provider that negotiates
//! the clock making it readable. [`crate::transport::webrtc`] declares those,
//! and they cross at the `*_webrtc_realtime` methods on
//! [`crate::JoinedNetwork`].
//!
//! The invariant here is about vocabulary, not dependencies: nothing public in
//! this module exposes or interprets provider metadata, and nothing here
//! converts between the two vocabularies. The stream leases do hold a
//! provider's reader in a private field — that is the generic claim-once
//! lifetime mechanism, carrying no media meaning of its own.
//!
//! There is therefore no configuration channel here: no opaque blob, no
//! key-value map, no purpose or authority string. A provider declares its types
//! rather than describing itself at runtime, and the method carrying them says
//! whose they are in its name — so nothing is left to validate and nothing in a
//! payload can name an authority.
//!
//! A label here is a bounded opaque name: 1..=255 bytes the application chose,
//! carried verbatim and never interpreted. Bounded because that is what the
//! encoded frame can spell, opaque because nothing on this side reads it, and
//! session-scoped because it means something only against the flow set that
//! accepted it.
//!
//! Publishing the connector's leased label, flow handles or ports would invite
//! reading one as a handle that grants something. What crosses instead is a
//! copy of the bytes, and it grants nothing: every operation resolves a live
//! session first, and the copy owns no part of the session's accounting for the
//! name it spells.
