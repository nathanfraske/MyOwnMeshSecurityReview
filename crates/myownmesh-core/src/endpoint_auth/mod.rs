//! Endpoint-authentication capability boundary for V4.
//!
//! This module states the boundary and re-exports the narrow internal types.
//! The work is owned by purpose-owned modules rather than gathered here:
//!
//! - [`context`] fixes what one task authenticates under, and derives the
//!   endpoint-authentication profile from the connector's closed binding;
//! - [`contribution`] owns the local draw and the accepted peer value;
//! - [`transcript`] owns the one signed framing and its role-canonical order;
//! - [`task`] owns the exchange: one draw, one bound peer contribution, one
//!   cached proof, one verified peer proof, and a terminal state;
//! - [`capability`] owns the issued capability and its private provenance.
//!
//! Endpoint authentication is transport independent. It names the generic
//! connector types — the handoff, the incarnation, and the binding — and
//! imports no `transport::webrtc` type. A future exporter, QUIC, serial, or
//! storage profile supplies another closed binding without changing the task.
//!
//! The channel-binding terms in the currently accepted profile are DTLS
//! certificate fingerprints, which are not session-unique; replay separation is
//! carried by per-attempt CSPRNG contributions and by connector-incarnation
//! ownership. See `BOUNDARY.md`.
