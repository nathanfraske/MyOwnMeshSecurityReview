//! Immutable construction context for one endpoint-authentication task.
//!
//! Everything a task authenticates *against* is fixed here, once, before any
//! contribution is drawn or any proof is built. Nothing in this type changes
//! for the life of the task, so a later caller cannot substitute a mesh, a
//! Device identity, a profile, or a channel binding after the fact.
//!
//! The context also owns the one place the role is decided: it is derived from
//! the exact Device pair, never supplied. Canonical ordering of the connector's
//! endpoint-relative binding components follows from that role and is applied
//! once, in [`super::transcript::transcript_bytes`], where the bytes are
//! actually framed. A transport therefore cannot choose roles, and no caller
//! can pick whichever ordering makes a signature verify.
