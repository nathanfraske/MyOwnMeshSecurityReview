//! Live two-connector endpoint-authentication controls.
//!
//! These are basal V4 controls. They are gated on `transport-lab` alone, and
//! they are the only controls that drive the production
//! `engine::handshake::on_auth_response` over a real DTLS link.
//!
//! The fixture opens two real WebRTC connectors, lets them complete ICE and
//! DTLS, and builds each side's [`EndpointAuthTask`] exactly the way the
//! production `DataChannelOpen` path does: the connector states its binding, the
//! context fixes the mesh and the Device pair, and the signing key moves into
//! the task. Nothing here reaches into task state or supplies a proof half.
//!
//! The two controls are twins over that one fixture. They construct identical
//! attempts and differ in exactly one value — the remote fingerprint the peer's
//! proof commits to — so the fingerprint field is load-bearing rather than
//! incidental: the negative fails *because* of the substitution, and the
//! positive proves the same construction promotes when nothing is substituted.
//!
//! `connect_before_engine_open` is the second fixture, and it exists because
//! `connect` performs the promotion itself. The open-path controls need the
//! production engine arm to be the thing that promotes, so that fixture stops at
//! the left connector's own native open callback and hands it over unconsumed.
//! It is the fixture, not a re-implementation of the arm: it opens the link and
//! nothing else. Both are named in code spans rather than linked: both are
//! `cfg(test)`, while this module compiles on the feature alone, so an
//! intra-doc link here would be broken in exactly the configuration the
//! `transport-lab` consumers build.

// The endpoint-authentication half of this module belongs to the twins, which
// are this crate's own controls. The link half is also reached from a
// `transport-lab` fixture in another crate, so it compiles whenever the feature
// is on; everything only the twins use stays behind `cfg(test)` so a
// feature-only build carries no unused item.
