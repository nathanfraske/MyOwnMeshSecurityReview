//! Wire protocol for peer connections.
//!
//! Every frame on the WebRTC data channel is one of the variants
//! below, serialized as a JSON object with a `kind` discriminator.
//! The pre-active phases are:
//!
//!   1. `hello` — each side announces its claimed Device ID, a random
//!      nonce, a verification code, and an optional capabilities
//!      blob. Sent immediately on channel open.
//!   2. `auth_response` — each side returns the other's nonce signed
//!      with its own private key. Receiving a valid signature
//!      authenticates that the sender owns the keypair matching its
//!      claimed Device ID.
//!
//! After mutual auth verification, the receiver side either
//! auto-accepts (peer is in the roster) or queues the request for
//! user approval. The receiver sends `approve` once cleared; the
//! connection becomes ACTIVE on both sides at that point.
//!
//! Post-active, peers exchange:
//!   - `capabilities_update` whenever local capabilities change
//!   - `shelve` / `unshelve` to negotiate topology
//!   - `ping` / `pong` for keepalive
//!   - `rpc_request` / `rpc_response` / `rpc_stream_chunk` /
//!     `rpc_stream_end` for embedder-defined request/response calls
//!   - Application data over typed user-defined channels (see
//!     [`crate::events`])
//!
//! Forward compat: a receiver getting an unknown `kind` silently
//! drops the frame. Peers gate optional traffic per-peer via
//! [`features`] capability negotiation so older peers aren't bombed
//! with frames they'll discard.
