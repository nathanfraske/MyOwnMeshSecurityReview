//! Wire frames for closed-network governance + roster gossip.
//!
//! Three families share this module:
//!
//!   1. **Network-state advertisement** ([`NetworkStateBroadcast`])
//!      — emitted on every ACTIVE transition so each peer can detect
//!      whether the other has news. Carries the network's current
//!      `kind`, the transition log length (so a stale receiver
//!      knows it needs an update), and the roster Merkle root.
//!
//!   2. **Proposal / ack / split** ([`NetworkStateProposeMessage`],
//!      [`NetworkStateAckMessage`], [`NetworkStateSplitMessage`])
//!      — the in-flight half of the governance flow. Each is
//!      individually signed under [`crate::SIGN_DOMAIN_TAG_STATE`].
//!      A receiver drops any frame whose signer set + variant
//!      doesn't satisfy the quorum table for its operation.
//!
//!   3. **Roster gossip** ([`RosterSummaryMessage`],
//!      [`RosterRequestMessage`], [`RosterEntriesMessage`]) — Merkle
//!      summary + diff fetch. v1 keeps the diff coarse: when roots
//!      disagree, the requester asks for the *full* roster (one
//!      `RosterRequest { include_all: true }` → one `RosterEntries`
//!      with everything). A tree-walk variant is wire-compatible with
//!      this shape and can ship in a later release without changing
//!      the message kind.
//!
//! These variants belong to the one current wire profile. The alpha has no
//! optional governance-feature gate or mixed-version fallback.
