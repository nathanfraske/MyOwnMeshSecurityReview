//! Per-device custody MFA (TOTP) for closed-network governance.
//!
//! A device may enroll a TOTP authenticator (RFC 6238, HMAC-SHA1, the
//! shape every standard authenticator app speaks) against a specific
//! network. Once enrolled, **this device refuses to *author* — propose or
//! co-sign — a governance transition for that network without a fresh
//! second-factor code**. It is a *local custody lock*: it guards this
//! device's signing authority against misuse (a transferred laptop, a
//! shoulder-surfer, a stray script), and it is deliberately **not** a
//! replacement for the network's cryptographic owner-quorum — that still
//! protects against *remote* forgery. The two compose: quorum says "enough
//! owners agreed", custody says "and this owner really meant it, here and
//! now".
//!
//! Scope is per `(device, network)`: each owner device enrolls its own
//! secret; there is no shared "fleet password" to leak. Enrollment lives in
//! `~/.myownmesh/.secrets/custody.json` (0600), never gossiped. A prepared
//! handoff also keeps its one-time recovery material in that protected file
//! until the handoff is explicitly committed or aborted, so a process restart
//! can re-deliver the exact transaction rather than silently losing custody.
//!
//! The gate is [`require`]; enrollment management is [`enroll`] /
//! [`is_enrolled`] / [`disable`]. Higher layers decide *which* networks must
//! enroll (e.g. a Fleet mandates it, a Mesh may not) — this module only
//! enforces the lock once it exists. Prepared installs carry a process-local
//! lease for diagnostics and duplicate admission, but durable recovery is
//! driven by the transaction record rather than lease death.
