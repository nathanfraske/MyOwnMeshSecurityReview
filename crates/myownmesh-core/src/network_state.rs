//! Compatibility snapshots for network policy and wire state.
//!
//! Canonical V4 authority lives in `semantic::FactGraph`. The transition,
//! proposal, and log fields below remain deserializable migration shapes for
//! older control clients; engine authority must be projected from canonical
//! facts and must not be created by these helpers.
//!
//! This module owns the types and signing primitives that distinguish
//! an `open` network (any member can write to the roster) from a
//! `closed` one (role-based authority enforced by signature
//! verification on every transition). See
//! [`docs/NETWORK-TYPES.md`](../../../docs/NETWORK-TYPES.md) for the
//! design.
//!
//! The on-disk shape is per-network state under
//! `~/.myownmesh/mesh/states/{network_id}.json`. Transitions are
//! ed25519-signed under the `myownmesh-network-state-v1:` domain tag,
//! distinct from the per-peer handshake domain so a handshake
//! signature can't be replayed as a state-transition signature or
//! vice-versa.
//!
//! Authority is enforced *at the engine layer* on every inbound
//! `network_state_*` frame: a peer that receives a proposal whose
//! signer set doesn't satisfy the quorum table drops the frame
//! silently and surfaces a diag entry. The GUI's role-grant gates
//! are convenience, not security — the wire is the security
//! boundary.
