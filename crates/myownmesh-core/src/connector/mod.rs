//! Capability boundary for connector-owned channel establishment.
//!
//! This Arc 02 module adds the ownership transition only. Existing WebRTC,
//! Arc 03 wraps the existing ICE, TURN, and connection behavior in this owner.
//!
//! Arc 04B-1 adds the transport-independent boundary that endpoint
//! authentication consumes, split by owner rather than by size:
//!
//! - [`incarnation`] owns the opaque process-local connector identity;
//! - [`handoff`] owns the move-only channel handoff and its retention contract;
//! - [`binding`] owns the closed connector-supplied channel binding.
//!
//! A transport keeps its own incarnation type and owns a generic one. Endpoint
//! authentication names only the generic types, so it imports no transport.
