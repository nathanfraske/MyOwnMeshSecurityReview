//! Session-bound, codec-opaque real-time flows.
//!
//! The outward half of the connector-local flow registry. The registry owns
//! admission, queueing and resource accounting and says nothing about codecs;
//! this module adds the two things an application needs and the registry
//! deliberately does not have: a binding to one authenticated session, and a
//! name both ends can say out loud.
//!
//! **Two names, two jobs, never substituted.** A flow has a process-local
//! identity (`RealtimeFlowKey`, an allocation address that is never serialized
//! and grants nothing) and a session-scoped label ([`RealtimeFlowLabel`]) that
//! does cross the wire. The identity answers "is this the same flow object";
//! the label answers "which of this session's flows do these bytes belong to".
//! Neither is ever used for the other's question, for the same reason the RPC
//! layer keeps a pending operation's identity apart from its binding.
//!
//! **Nothing here is authority.** Opening a flow and sending on one both
//! require a live [`RealtimeSessionBinding`]; a label gets a holder nothing at
//! all, because the receiving side has already been handed the bytes by the
//! time it reads one. That is what makes the label safe to publish and safe to
//! cite back after a restart.
