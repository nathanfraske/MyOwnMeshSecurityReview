//! What a flow is called, and what holding that name costs.
//!
//! Two types and one boundary between them. [`RealtimeFlowName`] is bytes that
//! have been checked for shape and nothing more — it owns no lease, grants
//! nothing, and is what crosses in and out. [`RealtimeFlowLabel`] is a name a
//! session has *accepted*: one shared record, one lease, and every copy naming
//! the same charge.
//!
//! They are separate types because the moment between them is the moment
//! admission happens, and a single type would make that moment invisible.

/// Which of one session's flows a unit belongs to.
///
/// This is the existing media lane coordinate generalized: assigned by the
/// opening side, pinned for the flow's lifetime, and published in the
/// application's own control messages so a receiver demultiplexes by explicit
/// binding rather than by inferring from arrival order. That inference was a
/// real bug — several concurrent feeds put one display's frames in another's
/// window — and the explicit label is what fixed it.
///
/// **Not a route or path identity, not a generation, not authority.** It names
/// one flow inside one authenticated session and nothing outside it. It is
/// never persisted. Session or connector-incarnation invalidation destroys the
/// whole label space with the session, and a value may be handed out again
/// only once the flow that held it is gone. Nothing orders two labels or
/// advances one.
///
/// **Opaque bytes, not a number.** What bounds a name's *size* is the frame
/// that carries it — [`crate::realtime::MAX_REALTIME_FLOW_LABEL_BYTES`], the
/// width of the encoded length prefix. What bounds how many exist at once is
/// admission, which answers with leases rather than with a fixed space. Those
/// are separate questions and neither is allowed to stand in for the other: a
/// numeric label makes the name's width into a concurrency ceiling, and a
/// concurrency ceiling stated anywhere but the owner's envelope is a second
/// number to drift from the first. The `Ord` below exists to key a map, not to
/// rank: nothing orders two labels meaningfully and nothing advances one.
///
/// The one property that is easy to lose and is load-bearing: a receiver that
/// has lost its entire route table can still cite a label back to the sender,
/// and the sender can resolve it. That is the only way to report a dead flow
/// whose name is exactly what was lost, so a label must stay meaningful to the
/// *peer*, not merely inside the process that minted it.
///
/// **One shared record and one lease, carried by every copy.** Not one
/// allocation: the record is an `Arc` block and the name is a `Box<[u8]>`
/// beside it, which is two, and `label_claim` charges both. What is singular
/// here is the record and the lease it holds, which is the property that
/// matters — cloning a label clones an `Arc`, so the held set, the flows map, a
/// queued arrival and an inbound binding all name the same bytes and the same
/// charge — released when the last of them drops, which is deliberately *not*
/// when the flow closes. A queued arrival outlives its flow; charging the
/// flow's own lease for the label would have released bytes that were still
/// retained.
///
/// Equality, ordering and hashing are by bytes, never by allocation address:
/// two labels naming the same bytes are the same label, which is what lets a
/// peer cite one back after this side has rebuilt everything else.
