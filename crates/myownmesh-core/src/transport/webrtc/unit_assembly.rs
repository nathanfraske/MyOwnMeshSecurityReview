//! Codec-neutral RTP unit assembly.
//!
//! The loss- and reorder-aware half of what used to be the H.264 assembler,
//! with every H.264 fact removed. What remains is RTP machinery and belongs at
//! the connector edge: sequence unwrapping across wraparound, timestamp
//! ordering, and the marker-bit contiguity rule that decides when a unit is
//! whole. None of it reads a payload byte.
//!
//! What it cannot decide for itself is supplied by a [`RealtimeUnitFraming`]
//! implementation: whether a payload can *begin* a unit, how a contiguous
//! fragment chain becomes one output unit, and whether that output is a
//! decoder entry point. Those are the only three questions here that have a
//! codec-specific answer, and each one is asked rather than assumed.
