//! WebRTC peer connection wrapper. Bridges webrtc-rs's callback-
//! driven API to a single mpsc the engine drains in its main loop.
//!
//! Lifecycle per peer:
//!
//! 1. Engine calls [`Transport::open_peer`] with [`Role::Offerer`]
//!    or [`Role::Answerer`]. A fresh [`PeerSession`] is returned.
//! 2. Offerer: [`PeerSession::create_offer`], then ship the SDP via
//!    signaling. Answerer: receive remote SDP, call
//!    [`PeerSession::set_remote_description`], then `create_answer`,
//!    then ship the SDP back.
//! 3. ICE candidates flow both ways via signaling; engine pushes
//!    inbound candidates into [`PeerSession::add_ice_candidate`].
//! 4. Once the data channel opens, the engine can [`PeerSession::send`]
//!    and observe [`TransportEvent::Message`] frames.
//! 5. Drop the [`PeerSession`] to tear down, or call
//!    [`PeerSession::close`] for explicit shutdown.
