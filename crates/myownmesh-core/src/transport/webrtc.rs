//! WebRTC peer connection wrapper. Bridges webrtc-rs's callback-driven
//! API to one bounded mailbox per connector worker.
//!
//! Lifecycle per peer:
//!
//! 1. The engine admits one connector candidate and calls
//!    [`Transport::open_connector_peer`] with [`Role::Offerer`] or
//!    [`Role::Answerer`]. A fresh [`WebRtcConnectorWorker`] owns the session.
//! 2. The worker creates and applies offers, answers, and remote descriptions;
//!    the engine moves the resulting transport control through signaling.
//! 3. ICE candidates flow both ways via signaling; the engine moves inbound
//!    candidates through its connector worker and the worker owns raw apply.
//! 4. A data-channel open promotes the exact connector candidate and hands its
//!    connected-channel capability to the Endpoint Auth Task.
//! 5. Connector retirement fences callbacks, drains owned work, and explicitly
//!    closes the native peer connection.

///   an observation about this table. Merging them would tie one to the other's

///   The record's own bytes are the node's business, not this claim's, and the
///   transceiver's are not a number Rust can state at all.

///   folded into the bytes above; the other three have no exposed size, and all

/// from an application close — the pump cannot tell them apart and does not
/// need to.

/// Dropping the sender `Arc` is **not** a detach. `remove_track` is what flips
/// the transceiver direction and stops the sender
/// (`peer_connection/mod.rs:1786-1791` in the vendored crate); until it runs the
/// connection still offers to send on that m-line. An earlier version of this
/// pump held the sender as `_sender` and returned, which retired nothing.
///
/// Two rechecks per unit, and both are needed:
///
/// - the queue upgrade, which is the **session** check. The queue is owned by
///   the flow, the flow by the flow set, the flow set by `PromotedSession`, so
///   a failed upgrade means the session that authorized this flow is gone.
///   Nothing else has to be consulted, and nothing else could be — the pump
///   runs outside the registry fence and cannot take it.
/// - `is_active`, which is the **connector** check. A connector can retire
///   while its session is still promoted, and writing to a retired
///   connector's track would push bytes through a transport this side has
///   already given up.
///
/// The write itself happens here rather than under the fence because it awaits,
/// and the fence is a sync mutex that connector replacement also takes.
///
/// Private, matching its parameter. `RealtimeOutboundPump` is `pub(super)` in
/// the flow module — visible exactly within the connector — so a `pub(super)`
/// here would have published a function whose argument type its own audience
/// could not name. Module privacy already reaches the one caller,
