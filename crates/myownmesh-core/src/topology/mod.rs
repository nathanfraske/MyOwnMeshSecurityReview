//! Topology selectors decide the *shape* of the network: which
//! connections exist at all, which of them carry application traffic,
//! who forwards frames for members that aren't directly connected, and
//! how a frame reaches a member across the shape.
//!
//! Selectors are pure functions. Every peer runs the same algorithm
//! over the same sorted input and arrives at the same answer — that's
//! what makes both shelving *and* connection-shaping safe without a
//! coordinator. Asymmetric transients (two nodes momentarily knowing
//! different member sets) are absorbed by the engine: refusing to
//! *initiate* a dial never refuses to *answer* one, and pruning fires
//! only once both sides have independently shelved the link.
//!
//! Historically selectors only picked the "preferred" (frame-carrying)
//! subset while every connection stayed open as a heartbeat path — so
//! ring and star modes still paid full-mesh connection costs (ICE
//! keepalives, DTLS, engine pings, TURN allocations) and a
//! hub-and-spoke deployment couldn't actually be evaluated.
//! [`Topology::edge`] is the connection-shaping half: modes that
//! return `true` from [`Topology::prunes`] dial only where an edge
//! exists, close both-sides-shelved non-edges, and route the rest
//! through forwarders ([`Topology::forwards`] /
//! [`Topology::next_hops`]) — see `engine::routing`.
