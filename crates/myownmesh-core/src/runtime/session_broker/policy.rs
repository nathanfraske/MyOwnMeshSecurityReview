//! The narrow temporary adapter from current policy to a promotion input.
//!
//! The promotion guard requires "Open or Closed policy currently allows the
//! peer". The live tree's answer to that question is
//! `PeerStateData::is_admitted()` — proven Device identity plus mutual approval.
//! This adapter is the one place that reads it for promotion purposes, and it
//! exists so the broker depends on a *proof value* rather than on a boolean it
//! could re-derive differently.
//!
//! Deliberately not a governance framework. It adds no policy, no Closed profile
//! selection, and no new authority: it carries the current answer, once, from the
//! fence that computed it to the promotion that consumes it. When the target
//! Semantic Node owns Open/Closed evaluation directly, this module is deleted and
//! the broker takes that owner's output in its place — which is why the value is
//! constructed only under the registry fence and cannot be stored, cloned, or
//! re-presented.
