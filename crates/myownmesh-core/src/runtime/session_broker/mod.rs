//! Session Broker: the one atomic promotion into `SessionCapability`.
//!
//! Arc 02 defined the output types and left the transition unimplemented. This
//! module implements it. Promotion consumes, in one call and with no partial
//! commit:
//!
//! - one `AuthenticatedChannelCapability` for the exact current connector;
//! - the current policy answer, produced by the narrow temporary adapter in
//!   [`policy`] over the engine's existing admission state;
//! - one explicit local process principal;
//! - exact post-authentication reservations for the promoted record and the
//!   refcounted validity block its delayed witnesses share.
//!
//! Two invalidations are structural rather than checked by a timer or a
//! generation counter. Connector replacement invalidates because the capability
//! privately retains the exact `ConnectorIncarnation` it was promoted from, and
//! every use compares that `Arc` by pointer identity against the installed one.
//! Process restart invalidates because nothing here is serializable, durable, or
//! reconstructible from a label — the whole chain is memory-only.
//!
//! There is deliberately no identity, attestation, or migration framework here,
//! no timer, generation, or route authority, and no compatibility mode. A
//! session is promoted or it is not.
