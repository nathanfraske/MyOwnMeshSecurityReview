//! What one promoted peer session owns on the application side.
//!
//! Everything here is reachable only through a live [`SessionCapability`], and
//! everything here dies when that session does. Both halves of that sentence are
//! load-bearing.
//!
//! The record has no key. It is a field of the promoted session, so a
//! replacement cannot name its predecessor's record any more than it can name
//! its predecessor's authority, and there is no map an operation could reach one
//! through.
//!
//! # The boundary between the children
//!
//! Three sub-responsibilities, one per module, none of which needs to read the
//! others' state:
//!
//! * [`slot`] — the promoted session bundle and the one slot a peer entry holds
//!   it in, with the install, reuse and revocation rules that govern it.
//! * [`reliable`] — acknowledged-delivery state: the frames retained until the
//!   peer acknowledges them, and the mark recording what this side has accepted.
//! * [`capabilities`] — what the peer advertised over this session, and whether
//!   this session still owes the peer the local advertisement.
//!
//! [`PeerSessionState`] below is the composition point and nothing more. It owns
//! one value from each child and forwards to it; the rules themselves live with
//! the state they govern, so a change to acknowledgement cannot silently alter
//! what an advertisement costs.
//!
//! The contract that follows, structurally rather than by discipline:
//!
//! * **Submission requires a current session.** The record does not exist until
//!   promotion creates it, so a caller whose peer has no live session is told
//!   that rather than parked against a session that may never exist.
//! * **Every retained frame holds its exact lease.** The bound is the provider
//!   refusing the next frame's own claim. Nothing is retained unpaid, and
//!   releasing a frame releases everything that frame was costing.
//! * **Revocation, replacement, retirement and shutdown resolve the caller.**
//!   All four are one act — dropping the promoted session — and the retained
//!   frame's own `Drop` is what answers the waits.
//! * **A peer that does not speak the acknowledged contract is refused.** An
//!   acknowledged-delivery wait is resolved by an acknowledgement or by nothing.
