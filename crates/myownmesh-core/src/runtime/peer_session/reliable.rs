//! Acknowledged-delivery state for one promoted session.
//!
//! Both directions of one reliable stream, owned by the session that carries it:
//! the frames this side retains until the peer acknowledges them, and the mark
//! recording what this side has accepted from the peer.
//!
//! The state machine is deliberately narrow, because every widening of it is a
//! way to report success for data that was never delivered:
//!
//! * **Only sent frames can be acknowledged.** A peer that learns the stream id
//!   from one frame can name any `up_to` it likes; settling on that alone would
//!   resolve callers `Ok` for frames still sitting in this queue.
//! * **Only the next sequence is accepted.** The data channel is ordered, so a
//!   gap is not a slow success — it is a frame that did not arrive, and
//!   advancing past it would let the sender settle everything it skipped.
//! * **One stream per session.** The sender mints its stream once; the receiver
//!   binds the first one it sees and refuses any other. A peer that could hand
//!   over a new stream value could reset this side's mark at will.
//! * **A caller is resolved while its frame is still funded.** Acknowledgement
//!   answers the wait and releases the retention together, so there is no
//!   interval in which the oneshot the retained claim paid for is still alive
//!   with its lease already gone.
//! * **A frame outlives its caller only where the wire requires it.** The
//!   retention exists to answer one waiter; when that waiter is gone the frame
//!   is released, unless releasing it would leave the peer waiting on a sequence
//!   this side has already spent. The caller's `Drop` is the only signal — no
//!   deadline, no attempt count, and nothing above this layer has to remember to
//!   cancel.
