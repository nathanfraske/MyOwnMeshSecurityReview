//! Local-principal and application-queue capability boundary for V4.
//!
//! The principal binding selected here is the **local process itself**: the
//! application operations this crate serves run in-process with the embedder, so
//! the operating-system principal that authenticated is the one already running
//! this code. That is a real binding, not a placeholder, and it is deliberately
//! the narrowest one that is true — there is no per-request principal inference,
//! no client label, and no identity or attestation framework.
//!
//! The owner itself is one type, `ApplicationGateway`, and its state is
//! declared here so that each submodule can reach exactly the fields its own
//! operations need. The submodules hold the operations, not a second owner:
//! `capabilities` the retained local advertisement, `channels` the named
//! subscriber queues, `frame` the encoded-frame admission and decode split,
//! `mailbox` the accepted-entry representation those queues are built on,
//! `principal` the local-process principal, and `rpc` the RPC seam.
