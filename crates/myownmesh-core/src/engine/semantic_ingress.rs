//! The Semantic Node's ingress: one transport-independent port for durable
//! semantic exchange.
//!
//! # Two ingresses, and why they are two
//!
//! `signaling_ingress` admits **ephemeral transport signals** — presence,
//! withdrawal, and the offer/answer/candidate exchange — from carriers nobody
//! authenticated. Everything it can emit is reachability evidence about one
//! connection attempt, and the closure of that union is what makes a relay
//! unable to touch a durable fact however it is fed.
//!
//! This module is the other half. It is not "the authenticated lane": it is the
//! lane where the *content* carries its own authority.
//!
//! | | ephemeral carrier ingress | durable semantic exchange |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | what it carries | evidence about one attempt | facts, bundles, inventories, requests |
//! | what makes it actionable | nothing — it grants nothing | the embedded author, signature and domain context |
//! | who may deliver it | any carrier | any carrier, cache, file or medium |
//! | may change the roster | never | that is what it is for |
//! | admitted by | [`super::signaling_ingress`] | [`DurableSemanticPort::admit`] |
//!
//! # Fact authority is content, not carrier
//!
//! ```text
//! fact authority = canonical content
//!                + embedded author and signature
//!                + exact mesh/domain context
//!                + causal/domain validation
//!
//! fact authority != the current carrier
//!                != the current session sender
//! ```
//!
//! An earlier revision of this module said the opposite — that a durable fact is
//! worth acting on because of *who stated it* — and the reducers enforced it:
//! a proposal, ack or split whose embedded author differed from the delivering
//! session's own pubkey was refused. That made a peer unable to relay a valid
//! signed fact authored by a Device this node cannot reach, and it made a cache,
//! a file, a serial link, removable media or a future durable carrier unable to
//! feed the same reducer without first minting a Peer Session. Endpoint
//! authentication protects a live session; it was never what makes a fact true.
//!
//! So [`reduce`] takes the session — when there is one — as a **reply route and
//! nothing else**. For [`Exchange::SignedFact`] that is a type property rather
//! than a promise: those arms are never handed the token, so the compiler is
//! what enforces it (see [`Exchange`]). [`Exchange::FactBundle`] does receive a
//! device id derived from the route, and it is diagnostics only — a
//! session-scoped label on a trace and a log line, never consulted to decide
//! whether the bundle is true. The bundle authenticates itself the same way a
//! single fact does.
//!
//! **What would be a defect, stated precisely.** Adding a durable body to the
//! *ephemeral* union would be one: it would put a fact on a carrier that cannot
//! say who sent it and has no signature to check. Adding a separate typed
//! durable-exchange carrier — a cache adapter, a file replay, a store — is the
//! opposite, and is the architecture this port exists to make possible.
//!
//! # What "closed" means here
//!
//! [`DurableSemanticExchange`] wraps a private enum. Nothing outside this module
//! can name a variant, so nothing outside can build one — the only way to obtain
//! the type is [`DurableSemanticPort::admit`], which is total over [`MeshMessage`] with no `_` arm. A
//! future durable message reaches this module or it reaches nothing.
//!
//! # Why the outcome is its own enum and not a `Result`
//!
//! "Not a durable exchange" is not an error — it is the ordinary case, and the
//! frame comes back whole for the engine to dispatch. A `Result` would have said
//! the opposite, and it would also have put a `MeshMessage` in an `Err`, which is
//! large: boxing the non-durable frame keeps the enum layout bounded by the
//! durable exchange arm while the classifier still moves that frame exactly
//! once.
