//! The Signaling Node's ephemeral-transport ingress: the one place a carrier
//! observation is admitted, and the only place it becomes an engine domain
//! value.
//!
//! `ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 states that signaling carries two disjoint categories —
//! durable semantic exchange and ephemeral transport control — and
//! `CURRENT-TO-TARGET-MIGRATION-MATRIX.md` requires that the two be
//! distinguished "before domain parsing". **This module is the ephemeral one,
//! and it is the only one that exists.** No carrier variant carries a durable
//! signed fact, so there is no durable ingress to write and none is pretended:
//! the distinction is carried by the type this module produces rather than by a
//! tag whose other value nothing can hold.
//!
//! What is enforced, and enforced by the compiler rather than by convention:
//!
//! - A carrier pump can only build a [`CarrierObservation`], whose constructors
//!   decide the [`EphemeralSignal`] kind. The parse into a domain value lives
//!   behind [`CarrierObservation::into_ingress`] and is private here, so
//!   "admit, then parse" is the only sequence that compiles.
//! - [`admit`] and [`outbound_signal`] are exhaustive with no wildcard arm. A
//!   new carrier variant does not inherit a kind; whoever adds one has to come
//!   here and say what it is, and a variant that is *not* ephemeral transport
//!   control has no kind to choose — which is the review this boundary exists
//!   to force.
//!
//! [`SignalingRuntime`] is the owner on this side of the boundary: it mints one
//! opaque [`CarrierInstance`] per attach and owns cross-carrier de-duplication,
//! whose every retained key is funded by the finite provider rather than capped
//! by a constant. It retains no untrusted record — see its own documentation for
//! the availability map that used to live there and why it was removed rather
//! than repaired.
//!
//! # What this boundary is not
//!
//! It moves no traffic on its own. It adds no anti-entropy, no proof delivery,
//! no retry, timer, poll, or acknowledgement, and it changes no eviction
//! behaviour. Nothing here can grant, revoke, or record membership.
