//! The state-watch **tick registry** — the engine's secondary control path.
//!
//! The engine has two control paths, and the split is deliberate:
//!
//! 1. **Events (primary).** Everything that *drives* state is event-driven and
//!    handled the instant it arrives in the driver loop's `select!`: a
//!    transport event (ICE-state change, data-channel open/close, an inbound
//!    frame), a signaling message (announce, offer, answer, candidate), a
//!    command. Recovery reacts to these immediately — a relay reconnect
//!    flushes reconnect intents, an inbound offer rebuilds, a data-channel
//!    close records an intent. Near-instant in the common case.
//!
//! 2. **Tickers (secondary).** Some conditions are the *absence* of an event —
//!    a data channel that never opened, a restart that never carried traffic,
//!    a reconnect that needs another nudge, a primary-IP that quietly moved.
//!    No event can signal "nothing happened", so a single periodic pass (the
//!    state-watch tick, configured by `NetworkConfig::scheduler`) confirms
//!    everything still looks right and repairs what doesn't.
//!
//! A [`Ticker`] is one such time-based subsystem. The driver builds a
//! [`TickRegistry`] of them at startup and runs the whole set on each tick.
//! New network-intelligence systems (smarter reconnect policy, presence
//! decay, route health, congestion sensing) register here as additional
//! tickers and interact with the engine through the same state + event model
//! the existing ones use — they read [`NetworkState`] and drive recovery via
//! the engine's normal actions, never by holding a lock across an await.
//!
//! In steady state every ticker is a cheap no-op: nothing is in a
//! transitional state, so the registry does no per-peer work.
