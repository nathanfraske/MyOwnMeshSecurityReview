//! The current peer installation map and the authorities minted under its
//! fence.
//!
//! One state class: which `PeerConnection` is installed under each device id
//! right now, and who is allowed to act on it. Three things live here and
//! nothing else does.
//!
//! * **The map.** [`PeerRegistry`] is the only owner that can install, replace,
//!   remove or retire a peer. Every ownership exit ends the connector worker,
//!   even when another task still holds an `Arc<PeerConnection>`.
//! * **The exact owner token.** [`PeerOwnerToken`] names one *installation*,
//!   not one device. A device id is a re-resolution key; a token is not, which
//!   is why every peer-reaching helper takes one.
//! * **The one-operation witnesses.** [`LogicalSessionOperation`],
//!   [`AdmittedInboundApplicationOperation`], [`AdmittedInboundDispatch`],
//!   [`AdmittedApplicationOperation`] and [`AdmittedRenegotiation`] are minted
//!   under the mutation lock and bind the exact installation they were admitted
//!   for. An admission answer never becomes a boolean that outlives the
//!   acquisition that decided it.
//!
//! The mutation lock is the linearization point. A fence holds it across the
//! whole effect, so replacement orders strictly before or after and never
//! between a check and the act it authorized. Everything run under it must be
//! synchronous, non-reentrant, and free to hand a value off but not to await.
