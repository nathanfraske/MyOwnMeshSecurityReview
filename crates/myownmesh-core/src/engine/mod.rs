//! Connection engine — the runtime that turns the protocol +
//! transport + topology primitives into a working mesh.
//!
//! Each joined network spins up one engine task graph:
//!
//! - **Driver** loop (`run_driver`) — owns the
//!   [`state::NetworkState`] and processes the per-network
//!   command queue, signaling events, and per-peer transport
//!   events serially.
//! - **Scheduler** ticks ([`scheduler`]) — heartbeat, offline
//!   check, reconnect prune, ICE poll. Each tick is named so the
//!   wake detector can attribute a tick gap to the right timer.
//! - **Per-peer transport pumps** — one task per active peer
//!   draining the transport mpsc into the driver via the command
//!   queue.
//!
//! Constants are mirrored from MyOwnLLM's `mesh-client.svelte.ts`
//! and are documented in `CONNECTION-ENGINE-FIELD-NOTES.md`. Do not relax them
//! without understanding the corresponding field-discovered bug.

///     that is deliberately dialled, and lex order would hand the restart

/// request id the inbound frame itself carried. That made a request
/// id an authority: any authenticated peer able to learn or guess
/// another peer's in-flight id could resolve that caller's oneshot
/// with a body of its own choosing, push chunks into that caller's
/// stream, or end the stream early — all under the victim peer's
/// identity, because the caller never learns who actually answered.
///
/// The source is now taken from `dispatch.owner()`, the owner token
/// minted when the frame was admitted, which names the peer the
/// transport actually authenticated. It is never the request id,
/// never a fresh registry lookup, and never anything the frame
/// carries: a sender cannot nominate its own authority.
///
/// **There is no comparison left to get wrong.** These arms used to hold a
/// bound canonical device on each pending operation and compare it against the
/// admitted owner, under a rule that deliberately admitted one replacement case:
/// the same device returning over a freshly authenticated connector was allowed
/// to complete a call its predecessor had filed. That rule is gone, along with
/// the field it was stated on.
///
/// What replaced it is ownership rather than comparison. The pending map is a
/// field of one `PeerSessionState`, so every arm below reaches it through
/// `with_captured_session_state` and can only ever see the operations *that
/// exact session* filed. A replacement session has its own empty map and no way
/// to name its predecessor's entries — not because a check refuses it, but
/// because there is nothing there to find. The predecessor's calls were already
/// resolved when it was retired: dropping a session drops its `SessionRpcState`,
/// whose `Drop` closes every pending sender and finishes every open stream, so
/// its callers are answered rather than left for a successor to answer.
///
/// So a replacement must **not** settle the old call, and the prose that said it
/// should has been removed rather than softened. A caller waiting on a session
/// that ended is answered by that ending, not by whoever authenticates next.
///
/// Each arm holds no pending-map guard across an await: it decides, funds and
/// extracts under the session-state fence, and nothing inside that fence

/// claims `Connected`. So a session whose ICE falsely reports `Connected`
/// while it carries no frames — exactly the corpse a peer that restarted (or

/// backstop is unreliable here: the rejoiner re-announces (so it *looks*
/// online) but, where it's the answerer, it waits for an offer its offerer —
/// still believing the link is up — never sends, a standoff that strands it
/// indefinitely. This is the "appears online, no connections, and even the
/// 90 s heartbeat doesn't fix it" report.
///
/// Drive recovery from the announce itself: if we hold the peer Active or
/// Shelved but haven't received a frame in `STALE_INBOUND_MS`, ping it and,
/// after `WAKE_PROBE_DELAY_MS`, rebuild it if it's still silent — the same
/// traffic-confirmed probe [`wake::on_wake`] runs, here triggered by the
/// peer's presence rather than an OS resume. The rebuild drops as
/// `HeartbeatTimeout` (a *recoverable* reason), so the offerer re-offers and
/// the answerer accepts a fresh offer and both ends realign — without
/// depending on the departing peer having managed to send a `Leave`. (The
