//! Connection engine — the runtime that turns the protocol +
//! transport + topology primitives into a working mesh.
//!
//! Each joined network spins up one engine task graph:
//!
//! - **Driver** loop (`run_driver`) — owns the
//!   [`state::NetworkState`] and processes the per-network
//!   command queue, signaling events, and per-peer transport
//!   events serially.
//! - **Scheduler** ticks ([`scheduler`]) — heartbeat, offline
//!   check, reconnect prune, ICE poll. Each tick is named so the
//!   wake detector can attribute a tick gap to the right timer.
//! - **Per-peer transport pumps** — one task per active peer
//!   draining the transport mpsc into the driver via the command
//!   queue.
//!
//! Constants are mirrored from MyOwnLLM's `mesh-client.svelte.ts`
//! and are documented in `CONNECTION-ENGINE-FIELD-NOTES.md`. Do not relax them
//! without understanding the corresponding field-discovered bug.
