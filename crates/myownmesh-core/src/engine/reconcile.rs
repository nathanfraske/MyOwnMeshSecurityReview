//! Tier 6 — user-driven configuration edits. Decides, when the user
//! edits a network's config at runtime, whether the change can be
//! applied in place ([`apply_hot`]) or genuinely needs the transport
//! torn down and rebuilt ([`requires_restart`], orchestrated by the
//! bin's serve loop — the engine task stops cleanly via Shutdown).
//!
//! Why STUN/TURN are *not* a restart
//! ---------------------------------
//! A full restart drops every live peer, including healthy *direct*
//! WebRTC links. That's a sledgehammer for STUN/TURN: those servers
//! only matter while *gathering candidates for a new connection* —
//! an already-connected data channel never touches them again. And
//! [`super::ensure_peer_session`] reads `stun_servers` / `turn_servers`
//! fresh from `state.config` every time it opens a peer, so a hot
//! update reaches every *future* connection (and every reconnect)
//! without disturbing the ones already up. So a STUN/TURN edit —
//! including a venue rotating its time-limited TURN credentials, which
//! otherwise churned the link on every refresh — applies in place.
//!
//! What still needs a restart
//! --------------------------
//! - `network_id`: a different wire-level network entirely (different
//!   room, identity context) — nothing to preserve.
//! - `signaling`: the Nostr driver binds its relay set at start and has
//!   no in-place "switch relays" path (the bridge's outbound receiver is
//!   taken once), so changing relays means recreating the driver. Rare —
//!   venues keep a stable relay set and rotate only credentials.
