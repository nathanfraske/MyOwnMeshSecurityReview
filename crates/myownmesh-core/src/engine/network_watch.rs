//! Network-change watcher. Polls the OS's chosen primary outbound
//! IPs every few seconds and, when they change, renegotiates ICE on
//! every active peer in this network — `restart_ice()` *plus* a fresh
//! offer, so both ends re-gather on the new interface and reconnect in
//! place (see `engine::renegotiate_ice`), rather than a bare local
//! re-gather the peer never hears about.
//!
//! Why this exists
//! ---------------
//! Without it, WebRTC only notices a network change when its
//! consent-freshness timer expires — ~30 s of silently sending
//! packets into the void after the user closes their laptop lid
//! and reopens on a different WiFi, or VPN comes up, or the
//! mesh interface changes IP for any other reason. The user
//! sees a connected peer status that quietly turns into
//! "reconnecting" half a minute later.
//!
//! By detecting the IP change in seconds and pre-emptively kicking
//! `restart_ice()` on every active peer, recovery starts
//! immediately and usually completes before the user notices.
//!
//! How we sample
//! -------------
//! Two complementary reads per poll:
//!
//! - **Primary source probes** — the well-known "bind a UDP socket and
//!   connect" trick: `connect()` on a UDP socket sends nothing, it just
//!   sets the default destination so `local_addr()` returns the source IP
//!   the OS picked. Probed toward the mesh's *own* STUN host when one is
//!   configured (the interface that routes to this mesh's relays is the
//!   one that matters, especially multi-homed), falling back to the
//!   public resolvers (8.8.8.8:53 / Google's v6) otherwise.
//! - **The full local address set** (via `if-addrs`), fingerprinted — v4
//!   addresses and v6 /64 prefixes, loopback/link-local excluded. This is
//!   what sees a change on a box with *no default route at all* (an
//!   internet-isolated LAN fleet: both probes read `None` forever) or on
//!   the interface the default route doesn't cover.
//!
//! Change detection is `last != current`, so any transition counts,
//! including up→down and down→up.
//!
//! Cost is one UDP socket bind + connect per poll, on the order of
//! microseconds. It runs on the shared state-watch tick (see
//! `STATE_WATCH_INTERVAL_MS` in `scheduler.rs`) rather than its own
//! interval — one periodic pass covers network-change detection alongside
//! the per-peer state confirmation.

/// dropped, never stored), which is exactly the "0 remote candidates arrived"
/// stall. `request_relay_reconnect` bumps the generation every relay task
/// watches, so they drop the zombie and reconnect at once. Same fix the wake
/// path uses for the identical post-suspend zombie (see `engine::wake::on_wake`).
///
/// The fan-out is then *driven by* that reconnect rather than raced against
/// it: we subscribe to the relay-connected signal before asking for the
