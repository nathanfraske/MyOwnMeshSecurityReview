//! Hello → auth_response state machine.
//!
//! This file owns wire translation and peer lifecycle. It owns no
//! cryptographic state: the context, both contributions, the transcript
//! framing, the signing key, the one cached local proof, and the terminal
//! state all belong to the exact current `EndpointAuthTask`. Nothing here
//! draws a contribution, assembles a transcript, selects profile semantics,
//! or signs.
//!
//! On data channel open:
//!   - Reads the task's own single contribution and a verification code.
//!   - Sends `hello { device_id, label, nonce, verification_code,
//!     features }`. No application capability metadata: the Hello is
//!     admitted before a session exists, and what this node offers is
//!     sent after promotion over `CapabilitiesUpdate`.
//!   - Watchdog scheduled at `HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT_MS`; up to three
//!     hello retries on the [`HANDSHAKE_HELLO_RETRY_SCHEDULE_MS`].
//!
//! On inbound hello:
//!   - Hand the typed peer contribution to the exact current task first,
//!     before recording anything from the frame, and send back the proof
//!     it returns.
//!   - The task classifies the Hello: a first binding, an exact
//!     retransmission answered from the cached proof with no draw and no
//!     second signature, or a conflicting value, which is the typed
//!     terminal `ConflictingPeerContribution` for that exact task — its
//!     own cause, never the currentness one.
//!   - Only a first binding records the peer's label, verification code
//!     and features, under the exact-current owner fence. A
//!     retransmission is answered without adopting any of them.
//!
//! On inbound auth_response:
//!   - Hand the wire signature to the exact current task, which verifies
//!     it against the transcript it already built. A one-directional
//!     proof is not accepted as mutual.
//!   - On success: install the `AuthenticatedChannelCapability` on the
//!     peer before any diagnostic admission state, emit `PeerAuthenticated`,
//!     decide approval (roster auto-approve or wait for user), send
//!     `approve` when cleared.
//!   - Duplicates are idempotent for a channel this exact current task
//!     already promoted; anything else fails closed.
//!
//! No alternate signature payload is produced or accepted on this path. The
//! fingerprint pair is not a session-unique exporter; see
//! `endpoint_auth/BOUNDARY.md`.
//!
//! On inbound approve:
//!   - If we've also sent ours, transition to `Active` and emit
//!     `PeerApproved`.
