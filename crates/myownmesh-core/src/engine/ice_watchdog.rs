//! `ICE_DISCONNECTED_RESTART_MS` after a peer's ICE state goes
//! `disconnected` — earlier than the underlying WebRTC stack's
//! own consent-freshness timer would notice a stale network.
//!
//! Recovery goes through [`super::renegotiate_ice`], which does
//! `restart_ice()` *and* sends a fresh offer — a bare `restart_ice()`
//! only re-gathers our own candidates and rotates our ufrag, which the
