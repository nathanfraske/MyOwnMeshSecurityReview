//! Acknowledged channel delivery — the engine's drive loop over state a
//! promoted session owns.
//!
//! The plain send path ([`super::send_to_peer`]) is best-effort: "send now or
//! error". This is the acknowledged contract: a frame is retained until the
//! peer's engine says it arrived, and the caller's wait resolves on that rather
//! than on a local write succeeding.
//!
//! **This module is a driver and holds no state.** Everything retained lives in
//! [`PeerSessionState`](peer_session::PeerSessionState), a field of the peer's
//! promoted session. Each operation resolves an owner, enters the registry
//! fence, and acts on the record the fence lends it.
//!
//! The contract that follows:
//!
//! * **Submission acquires the current session first.** A caller whose peer has
//!   no live session, or whose frame the provider will not fund retaining, is
//!   refused with that reason. A frame is retained under a session or not at
//!   all.
//! * **A frame ends on acknowledgement, with its caller, or with its session.**
//!   A caller that stops waiting takes its frame with it wherever dropping the
//!   frame leaves the wire contiguous — the session record's own
//!   `release_abandoned` decides where that is, because it is the only thing
//!   that knows what the peer has already been shown. Session end
//!   resolves the caller with the truth and the application decides whether the
//!   payload still means anything — which it is in a position to know and this
//!   layer is not.
//! * **Revocation and replacement need no code here.** Both drop the promoted
//!   session; the record goes with it and answers every wait on the way out.
//!
//! Delivery is exactly-once within a session: frames ride a `(stream, seq)`
//! pair, the receiver drops seqs at or below its high-water mark and
//! acknowledges cumulatively, so a retransmit cannot double-deliver. `stream` is
//! minted per session, which is what lets a late acknowledgement for a replaced
//! session be recognised and discarded rather than applied to the replacement's
//! frames.
//!
//! **This module is not the record's only writer, and nothing here may assume
//! it is.** Submission and flushing run on the engine driver task, through the
//! command queue and the state-watch tick. Inbound frames do not: each peer's
//! connector events are pumped by their own spawned task, which reaches
//! [`super::handle_inbound_frame_from`] and from there this session's
//! acknowledgement path. The two are concurrent.
//!
//! What orders them is the registry fence, per entry — and only per entry.
//! [`flush_owner`] deliberately releases it for the write, so the record can be
//! entered and mutated by the inbound task while a frame of this one's is on
//! the wire. That interval is real and is the reason `sent` is not a safe proxy
//! for "the peer has not seen this": it is set on a later acquisition than the
//! write it describes. An earlier version of the retention sweep read it that
//! way and could roll back a sequence the peer already held.
