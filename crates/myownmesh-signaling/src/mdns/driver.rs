//! Concrete mDNS/DNS-SD signaling driver — the LAN-local counterpart
//! of [`crate::nostr::driver`]. Discovery rides DNS-SD (one
//! [`wire::SERVICE_TYPE`] service instance per driver, room handle in
//! TXT); the SDP/candidate exchange rides a unicast TCP connection to
//! the port advertised in SRV, because an SDP with its candidate set
//! is far too large for TXT records.
//!
//! Deliberate properties:
//!
//! - **Clock-free.** No TLS, no timestamps — signaling works on a
//!   host whose wall clock is still at the epoch (a NanoKVM before
//!   its NTP sync), which is exactly the window local claiming has
//!   to cover.
//! - **Untrusted, like a public Nostr room.** Anything on the LAN
//!   can observe the advertisement or inject frames. The engine's
//!   ed25519 mutual-auth handshake over the DTLS channel that this
//!   signaling bootstraps remains the real authentication gate; a
//!   forged frame can at worst waste a handshake attempt.
//! - **Pluggable discovery backend.** The registration/browse half lives
//!   behind [`super::discovery`]: the pure-Rust `mdns-sd` daemon by default
//!   (per-driver socket set, coexists with a system daemon via
//!   SO_REUSEADDR/SO_REUSEPORT), or the platform's own DNS-SD daemon through
//!   the `dnssd` C API on iOS (raw multicast sockets are entitlement-gated
//!   there; mDNSResponder isn't). The exchange below is backend-independent.
