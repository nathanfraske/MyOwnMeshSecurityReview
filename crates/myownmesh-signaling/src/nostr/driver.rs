//! Concrete Nostr signaling driver. Connects to N relays in
//! parallel, publishes ephemeral signaling events tagged with
//! the room handle, subscribes to inbound events on the same
//! tag, and routes them back to the caller via mpsc channels.
//!
//! Resilience features baked in (see `crate::upstream`):
//!
//! - The subscription REQ is re-sent on every fresh socket, and the
//!   per-socket reconnect backoff (operator-configured, jittered) is the single
//!   anti-flood pace for a flapping relay.
//! - Transition-only logging — no per-event spam.
//! - Directed negotiation (offer / answer / candidate) is tagged with
//!   its recipient (`["p", device_id]`) and the subscription asks for
//!   "presence + directed-to-me", so the relay never fans a pairwise
//!   negotiation to the whole room (see `desired_filters`).
//!
//! The driver is independent of the engine; the
//! [`crate::SignalingChannel`] trait is the seam.
