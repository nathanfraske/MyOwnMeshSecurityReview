# myownmesh-updater

Self-update for the `myownmesh` binary. Pulled separately so an
embedder that ships its own update story doesn't inherit ours.

```toml
myownmesh-updater = { git = "https://github.com/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh", tag = "v0.2.30" }
```

## Lifecycle

1. Background ticker polls the release feed every
   `check_interval_hours` (default 6). Each feed and artifact request uses
   its explicit `auto_update.feed_request_timeout_ms` and
   `auto_update.artifact_download_timeout_ms` owner-configured limits
   (defaults 15000 and 300000 milliseconds); zero values are rejected.
2. Latest version compared to running `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`. If
   newer and policy permits, the asset is downloaded.
3. SHA-256 verified against the sidecar `.sha256` published next
   to the artifact.
4. Extracted into `~/.myownmesh/updates/<version>/` with a
   `pending.json` marker.
5. On next process start, `apply_pending_if_any()` atomically
   swaps the running binary.

Package-manager installs (Homebrew / apt / rpm / MSI / choco) are
detected on first launch and self-update is skipped — the OS
package manager stays the source of truth.

Only the `myownmesh` daemon binary is self-updated. The GUI
(`myownmesh-gui`) ships its own bundle; it auto-spawns whichever
daemon is on PATH, which this keeps current.

## CLI

The daemon stages updates in the background; drive it by hand with:

```
myownmesh update check          # force a check now and stage if permitted
myownmesh update apply           # apply a staged update (effective next start)
myownmesh update status          # version, channel, policy, last check, staged
myownmesh update enable          # turn background checks on
myownmesh update disable         # turn background checks off
```

`check` and `status` take `--json`. `MYOWNMESH_AUTOUPDATE=0` hard-
disables self-update regardless of config.

## Configurable release URL

Build-time env defaults:

```
MYOWNMESH_RELEASE_URL_STABLE  → github.com/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh/releases/latest
MYOWNMESH_RELEASE_URL_BETA    → github.com/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh/releases
```

Runtime overrides in `~/.myownmesh/config.json`:

```jsonc
  {
    "auto_update": {
      "channel": "stable",
      "auto_apply": "all",
      "feed_request_timeout_ms": 15000,
      "artifact_download_timeout_ms": 300000,
      "stable_url": "https://your.cdn/myownmesh/latest"
  }
}
```

## Apply policy

`auto_update.auto_apply`:

- `patch` — `0.1.5 → 0.1.6` only
- `minor` — `0.1.5 → 0.2.0` ok
- `all`   — any upgrade
- `none`  — stage but never auto-apply

See [`../../RELEASE.md`](../../RELEASE.md) for the publisher side
of the contract — how artifacts get into the feed this crate
consumes.
