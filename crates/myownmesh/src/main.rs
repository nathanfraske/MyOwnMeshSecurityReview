//! MyOwnMesh daemon + CLI entry point.

//! Persona selection happens on the first argv inspection: with no
//! arguments we launch the desktop GUI (`myownmesh-gui`), matching
//! MyOwnLLM where a bare invocation opens the app. `serve` runs the
//! daemon in the foreground — the explicit headless entry point, and
//! what the GUI auto-spawns as its own child. Any other subcommand is
//! `ctl …`-style and addresses the running daemon via the control
//! socket.
