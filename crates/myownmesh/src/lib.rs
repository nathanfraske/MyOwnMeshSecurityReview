//! The MyOwnMesh **daemon**, as a library.
//!
//! The `myownmesh` binary (this package's bin target) is a thin CLI over the
//! modules here. They are exposed as a library for one reason: so a host
//! application that is **forbidden from spawning processes**, such as an iOS
//! app where the sandbox allows neither fork nor exec, can run the same daemon
//! inside its own process via [`embedded::start_connector_capable`], instead of
//! re-implementing the daemon's behaviour piece by piece.
//!
//! Everything else about the daemon is unchanged: it still listens on the
//! control socket (a unix socket inside the app sandbox on iOS; sockets are
//! allowed; processes aren't), speaks the same wire protocol, and hosts the
//! same registry/services, so existing clients (`myownmesh ctl`, the GUIs, and
//! any embedding application's own sidecar) work against it identically whether
//! it runs as a process or embedded.

/// That is the whole claim, and it is the only one this guard can make good on.
/// A daemon test that opens a `Mesh` without a connector policy draws nothing
/// here and correctly takes no guard — `services`'s infrastructure-only tests
/// are the live example. Nothing in this workspace enforces one `Mesh` per
/// process, so do not read this guard as an identity or incarnation lock.
///
/// This replaces one mutex per test module — `ipc::bridge`, `embedded` and
/// `registry` each had their own. Each stopped a family racing itself and none
/// stopped the families racing each other, so with `libtest` running the binary
/// in parallel, three tests could draw on a budget of four connectors at once.
/// Three owners for one resource is the same defect shape the registry
/// supervisor itself exists to remove, and correcting that ownership is the
/// whole reason this guard exists — not a repair for any particular observed
/// failure. It was written while the bridge round trips were timing out waiting
/// for `PeerApproved`, and it did not fix them: they time out identically when
/// run alone with no other connector fixture in flight, so whatever those tests
/// are waiting on, it is not this budget.
///
/// Hold the guard for the fixture's whole life, teardown included. Releasing it
/// at the last assertion would let the next test ask for capacity the previous
/// one has not finished returning.
///
/// The `static` lives inside this function so there is exactly one and no module
/// can declare a second by accident.
