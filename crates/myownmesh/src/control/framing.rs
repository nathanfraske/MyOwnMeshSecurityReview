//!
//! Two framings, deliberately together. A control connection speaks
//! line-delimited JSON until it becomes a `realtime_pipe`, after which it speaks
//! `[u32 len][body]` and nothing else — so a connection uses one or the other,
//! never both at once, and the thing they share is the only interesting part:
//! every inbound byte is acquired from the process owner's grant before this
//! module buffers it. The one allocation that rule cannot reach is the reader's
//! own window, which the runtime has already filled before any code here runs;
//! it is funded once by the caller, before the reader exists, and named as such
//! rather than folded into this sentence. Splitting the two framings would have
//! put one admission rule in two files.
//!
//! Nothing here knows what a request means, what a network is, or which client
//! is asking. It reads bytes, refuses the ones nobody funded, and hands the rest
//! up. That is the whole of its authority: it decides *how much*, never *what*.
