// A flow's direction and RTP kind are not redeclared here either.
// `Request::RealtimeFlowOpen` carries `RealtimeFlowDirection` and
// `WebRtcRtpKind` directly, so the value a client sends is the value handed to
// core with no daemon-side mapping in between. A local pair of enums with the
// same two variants would read as harmless and would be the place a translation
// bug eventually lives — one `match` arm crossed, and every outbound flow
// becomes an inbound one.
//
// The two come from different layers on purpose. Direction is basal: which way
// units travel is true of any flow and names no media, so it lives in the
// generic vocabulary. RTP kind is a WebRTC fact — it exists because RTP
// allocates a transceiver per kind — so it is spelled `WebRtcRtpKind` and lives
// at the provider edge. A client naming it is unambiguously naming a WebRTC
// thing, which is what stops a fixed audio/video taxonomy leaking back into the
// layer that is supposed to know nothing about media.
//
// [`RealtimePipeDirection`] stays local because it is not the same thing: it
// names a socket's role, and there are no pipes in core.

// Refusal codes are not redeclared here. `myownmesh_core::realtime::
// RealtimeRefusal::code()` is the one source of the stable strings
// (`session_not_current`, `label_in_use`, `flow_refused`,
// `provider_configuration_invalid`),
// and the daemon forwards what it is given. A daemon-side copy of the enum
// would be a second place to add a variant and a silent way to drop one: a new
// core variant would fall through a local `match` to some default string,
// where forwarding `code()` makes the same change a compile error here.
//
// Note the absent `label_space_exhausted`. The caller supplies an exact name
// and the connector claims that one — it never allocates — and there is no
// enumerable space of names to exhaust, so a name is free or in use and nothing
// can be "full" from a request's point of view. How many flows may be open at
// once is a separate question, answered by `flow_refused` from admission.

    /// It is checked against the flow this pipe is bound to and refused if it
    /// disagrees, so a client that muddles its own names hears about it rather
    /// than having units silently rerouted.
    ///
    /// `Inbound` is bound by `network` + `peer`, and that is a different
    /// question: it claims one *session's* whole unit stream, not one flow, and
    /// the stream reader it gets is itself the exact authority — it can only
    /// ever yield units the claiming session's own flow set put there. There is
    /// no coordinate to re-resolve after the claim.

    /// The binding is also a lifetime, and it is observed rather than
    /// signalled. There is no flow or session event on any socket: a separate
    /// signal would be a second source of truth that can disagree with the
    /// queue, and this is where the end is actually observable. Dropping the
    /// session's `PromotedSession` drops its flow set and
    /// the queued units with it, and each direction learns that from the queue
    /// it already holds:
    ///
    /// - inbound terminates when the session-owned recv queue closes;
    /// - outbound terminates on a closed queue, or on `session_not_current`
    ///   from the synchronous send.
    ///
    /// Either way the pipe ends with the session rather than outliving it,
    /// which would be a send outliving its flow one layer up. The client then
    /// reconnects and may immediately reuse the same names — a name belongs to
