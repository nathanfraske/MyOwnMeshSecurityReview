//! Governance control dispatch for the canonical semantic authority model.
//!
//! Durable authority is represented by verified `SignedFact` records in the
//! semantic `FactGraph`; this module only authorizes bounded control replies
//! and forwards typed authoring requests to the joined-network facade.
//!
//! Roster data is a read-only projection and never a source of membership or
//! role authority. Response ownership is acquired before any variable-size
//! result is traversed, encoded, or sealed.
