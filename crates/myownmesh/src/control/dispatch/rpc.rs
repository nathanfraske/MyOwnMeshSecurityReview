//! Local RPC operations: handler registration, in-flight resolution, the
//! outbound call, and the streaming call with the frame builders that forward
//! it without constructing anything the writer mailbox has not admitted.
//!
//! Four of these carry a `client_id` and the capability that proves it, and
//! every one of those checks it first — before a network lookup, before a
//! reply is measured, before anything is claimed. Registration is the reason
//! this matters most: a method claim is process-wide state, so an
//! unauthenticated caller must not be able to reach the point where one is
//! taken and then released.
//!
//! Like every operation module here, nothing writes. Each function answers
//! with an [`Answer`]: the reply, and the line capacity it was admitted under.
//! The connection loop encodes and writes.
