//! The four updater operations.
//!
//! The updater crate hands out its own operation plan, so these do not use the
//! shared `variable_operation_claim` for the two that read updater state:
//! `prepare_operation` reports what its own work will cost, the connection
//! admits exactly that, and the lease goes back into `run`. `apply` is the
//! exception — it answers with a plain outcome rather than an updater value,
//! so it uses the ordinary operation residual like every other operation.
