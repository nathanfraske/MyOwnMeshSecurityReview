//! The operations behind the control protocol's request match.
//!
//! The exhaustive `match` over [`Request`](super::Request) lives with the
//! connection loop in `control.rs`, and stays there: totality is a property of
//! one match over one enum, and per-domain sub-enums would need a `_ =>`
//! somewhere to glue them back together. What lives here is the work an arm
//! delegates to: the per-domain operation modules, and the shared helpers each
//! of them funds an answer or a refusal through.
//!
//! No function here takes a `Request`. Each takes the fields its arm
//! destructured, so nothing below the total match can be handed a variant it
//! does not handle, and the connection loop's match over `Request` is total,
//! so the compiler enforces that.
