//! Daemon control protocol — line-delimited JSON over a local
//! interprocess socket (unix-domain socket on Unix, named pipe on
//! Windows). `myownmesh ctl …` clients and the GUI both talk to the
//! running daemon via this socket.
//!
//! Wire shape: one JSON object per line. Requests have `op` plus
//! op-specific fields; responses have `ok` (bool) plus
//! op-specific payload, or `error: string` on failure.
//!
//! Most ops are single-shot request → response. The exception is
//! [`Request::EventsSubscribe`], which converts the connection into a
//! one-way server-push stream: the daemon writes one JSON event per
//! line until the client disconnects. The GUI's Tauri backend uses
//! this to forward live mesh events into the frontend.
