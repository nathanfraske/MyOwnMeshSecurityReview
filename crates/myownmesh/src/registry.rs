//! Per-daemon registry of joined networks, keyed by both the user-chosen
//! config id and the wire-level network id. The control socket uses
//! this to address per-network operations (peers list, roster mutations,
//! topology changes, add/remove) without `serve.rs` having to thread a
//! handle through every dispatch arm.
//!
//! Each entry pairs a `JoinedNetwork` with its `SignalingDrivers` — the
//! signaling driver set (Nostr and/or mDNS, per the network's
//! strategy) is per-network, and dropping the handle stops it.
//!
//! # One lifecycle owner
//!
//! This registry is the only owner of a joined runtime's lifecycle, and
//! [`RuntimeState`] is the only place the answer lives.
//!
//! An `Arc` refcount cannot stand in for it. A refcount answers "is this value
//! shared", which is a different question — a runtime with one in-flight
//! control request and a runtime that has finished tearing down are both "not
//! solely owned" — and dropping the command sender does not exit the engine,
//! because `NetworkState` holds that sender itself. An engine left running with
//! live sessions while no key in this map could reach it would be joined beside
//! by the next `network_update` under the same configuration, leaving a hidden
//! runtime next to the visible one.
//!
//! Four properties carry it instead, and each is structural rather than
//! observed:
//!
//! * a runtime is claimed for teardown, unlinked, and moved to the closing set
//!   in **one** acquisition of the registry's state lock, so there is no
//!   instant in which it is unreachable, unowned, or invisible to the check a
//!   concurrent insert makes;
//! * a `Closing` entry stays owned here until teardown completes, so no live
//!   runtime is ever ownerless;
//! * a replacement under either id is refused while **any** runtime holding
//!   either id is not yet `Stopped` — `Running` as well as `Closing`. A
//!   `Running` collision falling through to the map would let `insert`
//!   overwrite one alias while `or_insert` left the other pointing at the
//!   predecessor: two live runtimes, one half-reachable, neither being torn
//!   down;
//! * every caller that loses the race to claim a teardown **waits for the
//!   winner** and observes `Stopped` before returning. Answering "already
//!   closing" and returning immediately would let `shutdown_all` finish while a
//!   concurrent removal was still awaiting an engine driver, exiting the daemon
//!   with that engine live.
//!
//! Teardown itself needs no unwrapping: [`JoinedNetwork::shutdown`] takes
//! `&self` and is idempotent, so the supervisor drives it through the shared
//! handle rather than requiring unique ownership of every outstanding facade.
//! A loser calls it too — that is what makes "wait for the winner" go through
//! the runtime's own seam rather than through a second mechanism — and then
//! waits on [`Lifecycle::await_stopped`], because `shutdown` returning proves
//! the driver is retired and not yet that this registry has finished
//! bookkeeping the fact.
//!
//! Concurrency: one [`parking_lot::Mutex`] guards the aliases and the closing
//! set together, because every decision here is about both. Callers pull an
//! `Arc<JoinedNetwork>` out and drop the guard before awaiting any per-network
//! method — holding a `parking_lot` guard across `.await` is forbidden, and no
//! path here does.
