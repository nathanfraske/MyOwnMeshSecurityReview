//! Engine ↔ IPC bridge: synthetic `Rpc::serve` / `serve_stream`
//! handlers that route inbound peer RPCs to whichever IPC
//! client currently holds the matching method claim, plus the
//! per-channel pump task that fans `Channel::subscribe()`
//! frames out to subscribed IPC clients.
//!
//! Lifetime model:
//!
//! - **Handlers** are installed lazily on first claim of a
//!   `(network, method)` pair and forgotten on the last unclaim —
//!   whether that unclaim is an explicit `RpcUnregister` or the
//!   disconnect of the client that held it. Installing is an
//!   admission the engine can refuse, and the refusal is answered
//!   to the claiming client rather than swallowed: a claim whose
//!   handler was never installed would route nothing.
//!
//!   Each installed handler holds retention in the network's gateway scope,
//!   so the last unclaim removes it. A handler invoked during removal still
//!   answers "no claim" truthfully.
//!
//! - **Channel pumps** are owned by a route, not by a subscriber count. The
//!   first subscribe creates the route and installs the pump; the last
//!   unsubscribe retires the route, which cancels the pump and *joins* it, so
//!   the unsubscribe returns only once the task has actually stopped.
//!
//!   Cancellation cannot depend on another published frame: a quiet channel
//!   may have no next receive on which the pump could notice retirement.

    /// to produce, by running the handler body core runs, on a call that is
    /// genuinely parked mid-flight when the method changes hands.
    ///
    /// The sequence, and why each step is there:
    ///
    /// 1. `A` publishes single-shot through the production path: a real
    ///    `PreparedRegistration`, a real `commit_with` running the daemon's
    ///    claim under core's handlers lock, a real `OwnedMethodRegistration`.
    /// 2. A newcomer the daemon refuses publishes nothing, and `A` keeps its
    ///    owner, its class *and* its generation. Under an install-then-claim
    ///    order the incumbent's handler would already be overwritten by the
    ///    time the refusal was discovered.
    /// 3. A call is started under `A`'s generation and parks at the real park
    ///    point — awaiting `A`'s `RpcRespond`. The barrier is `A`'s own mailbox
    ///    receiving the inbound frame, which cannot happen until the call has
    ///    resolved its owner, filed its pending entry and handed the frame over.
    ///    No timer decides anything.
    /// 4. `B` takes the method as a stream, for real, while that call is parked.
    /// 5. The parked call comes back *displaced*, not answered by `B`. This is
    ///    the observation the predicate alone cannot make: the in-flight call is
    ///    settled truthfully by the displacement rather than left to resolve
    ///    against whoever holds the name when it wakes.
    /// 6. `B` was never told about `A`'s call — its mailbox is empty. A stale
    ///    clone re-run afterwards refuses truthfully and still tells `B`
    ///    nothing.
    /// 7. The installation that *is* published reaches `B`, in the stream shape
    ///    it claimed.
    ///
    /// What this does not observe is core cloning the closure itself: the body
    /// is invoked directly, one call away from where core invokes it, because
    /// reaching core's own dispatch would need a second engine and a peer
    /// handshake to watch a transaction that has nothing to do with peers. The
    /// closure passed to core is this same function and nothing else.
