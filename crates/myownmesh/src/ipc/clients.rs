//! Per-connection state and the daemon-wide indices that route
//! inbound RPCs / channel messages to the right client.
//!
//! One `ClientHandle` per event-subscribed socket. It owns the outbound writer
//! and an unguessable capability presented on later command connections.
//!
//! The registry maintains five indices:
//!
//! - `clients` — every connected event-subscribed client, keyed
//!   by `ClientId`. Dropped on disconnect.
//! - `handler_claims` — which client owns each method name on
//!   each network. Last-claim-wins: a re-register evicts the
//!   prior owner with a `HandlerDisplaced` event.
//! - `channel_subs` — set of subscribed clients per (network,
//!   channel). Channel inbound events fan out to every member.
//! - `exact_pending_inbound` — full remote coordinates, response class,
//!   claiming connection owner, method claim and private local operation id.
//! - `installed_handlers` — which shape of synthetic handler the bridge has
//!   installed for each claim, so a re-claim can be answered without asking
//!   the engine what it already holds.
//!
//! Every one of them is a [`LeasedMap`], and every entry in every one of them is
//! funded before it exists. That is what makes each of these tables bounded by
//! the process owner's grant rather than by how many method names a local client
//! feels like claiming: an index node is memory the daemon holds on a client's
//! say-so, and a table that admitted entries for free would be an unmetered way
//! for one local process to grow the daemon. So each insertion is an admission
//! and each can be refused, and every removal — including the one that happens
//! when a table is dropped with entries still in it — releases exactly what that
//! entry took.
//!
//! **One lock over all five.** They sit together in [`RegistryTables`] behind a
//! single mutex rather than one mutex each, because almost every operation here
//! touches more than one of them — claiming a method writes three tables, a
//! disconnect writes four — and five locks would mean five acquisition orders to
//! keep consistent forever. Nothing under this lock awaits, and a client's own
//! tables are only ever locked while this one is held, never the reverse.
//!
//! **What is here and what is not.** This file declares the state and what it
//! costs: the tables, the records, the handle, and the exact claims that fund
//! each of them. What the registry *does* with that state is [`registry`], a
//! descendant — which is what lets it hold every operation while every field
//! above stays exactly as private as it was. A sibling module or an outside
//! caller still reaches none of it.
