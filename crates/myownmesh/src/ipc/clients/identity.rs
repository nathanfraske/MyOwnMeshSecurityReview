//! Four names and nothing else: a routing coordinate, a table key, and two
//! unforgeable authorities. None of them knows what a registry is, none holds a
//! resource, and none can be constructed from outside this module tree — which
//! is the point of putting them together. An authority that any caller could
//! mint would authorise nothing.
//!
//! The split is by what a value *is*, not by what uses it. These are all reached
//! from the registry, the handle and the pending table alike, so filing them
//! under any one of those would have made the other two reach across.

/// Process-unique identifier for a connected client.
///
/// Just a monotonic counter; the daemon never reuses ids, so a
/// stale reference in a forwarder task that races with
/// disconnect resolves to a `None` lookup instead of routing to
/// a different client.
///
/// Wire form is the `Display` shape `c<n>` — clients pass it
/// back verbatim on subsequent RPC/channel-management requests
/// to identify which event-subscribed connection a handler
/// claim belongs to.
/// `Ord` is derived because this is a [`LeasedMap`] key, and the order is the
/// counter's own: ids sort by the sequence they were issued in. Nothing depends
/// on that ordering being meaningful — it exists so the tables can be searched.
