//! Wire frames the daemon writes to a duplex (post-
//! `EventsSubscribe`) client connection. Every line is exactly
//! one of these variants, tagged via the `kind` field so a
//! client can dispatch on it without trying to guess from
//! shape.
//!
//! Backward compat: `Event` / `Lagged` were the only `kind`s
//! the original event stream emitted, and new variants land
//! additively without breaking the existing MyOwnMesh GUI
//! client. That tolerance is real, but it is not where this
//! comment used to say it was — there is no `kind` match in
//! `gui/src-tauri/src/main.rs::run_event_pump` to have a
//! default arm. That pump never inspects a frame at all: it
//! relays each line to the frontend verbatim as a
//! `mesh://event`. The dispatch lives one layer further out,
//! in `gui/src/mesh-client.svelte.ts`, which branches on the
//! `kind` it recognises and renders anything else generically.
//! A client that must act on a new variant still has to learn
//! it; what is guaranteed is that not knowing one is not an
//! error.
