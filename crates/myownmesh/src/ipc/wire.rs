//!
//! Backward compat: `Event` / `Lagged` were the only `kind`s
//! the original event stream emitted, and the existing
//! MyOwnMesh GUI client already ignores unknown kinds via its
//! `match _ => {}` default in
//! `gui/src-tauri/src/main.rs::run_event_pump`. New variants
//! land additively without breaking it.
