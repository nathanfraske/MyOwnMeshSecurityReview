//! One real two-peer link, for every daemon family that needs one.
//!
//! Nothing here is a stand-in: two engines are spawned, attached to one
//! [`LocalBroker`], and awaited until each has genuinely approved the other, so
//! a control built on this is exercising the same handshake, the same
//! dispatcher pair and the same connector budget production uses.
//!
//! **It lives at the crate root because two families need the same link, not
//! because it is general.** It was `ipc::bridge`'s private fixture, and the
//! second caller — the control dispatcher's streaming tests — needs a link
//! indistinguishable from the one the bridge controls run on. Copying it would
//! have produced two fixtures free to drift apart while both claimed to be "a
//! real two-peer link", and the drift would show up as a control passing
//! against a link its sibling no longer builds. So it moved rather than
//! multiplied, and `ipc::bridge` now calls exactly what it used to define.
//!
//! `#[cfg(test)]` and `pub(crate)`: it is reachable from any test in this
//! binary and from nothing else. No production path can name it, and no
//! production build contains it.
//!
//! **Serialization is not here and must not be added here.** Every caller takes
//! [`crate::exclusive_connector_fixture`] first, because building a `Transport`
//! at all draws on the one process-global connector budget that `embedded`,
//! `registry` and the bridge families all share. A mutex local to this module
//! would only stop this module's callers racing each other, which was never the
//! problem.
