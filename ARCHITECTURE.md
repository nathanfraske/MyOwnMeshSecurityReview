# MyOwnMesh fundamental hybrid networking architecture

Status: owner-adopted V4 architecture, source revision `2a04e29e0a4c09b95a4914972018850ddb2cbacb`.

This document defines the smallest common architecture for MyOwnMesh discovery, durable mesh semantics, signaling, transport path construction, endpoint authentication, session recovery, and application data delivery.

MyOwnMesh is a **transport-independent hybrid networking system**. Transport independence means that a durable fact does not gain or lose authority because of the medium that carried it. It does not mean that transport is optional, external to the system, or operationally interchangeable. Discovery, signaling, candidate gathering, connectivity checks, relay allocation, congestion behavior, packet carriage, recovery, and reachability remain first-class parts of MyOwnMesh.

The mathematical model is in [`FORMAL-PROOFS.md`](FORMAL-PROOFS.md). Concrete constraints and invariants are in [`IMPLEMENTATION-CONSTRAINTS-AND-INVARIANTS.md`](IMPLEMENTATION-CONSTRAINTS-AND-INVARIANTS.md). The application boundary is in [`APPLICATION-INTEGRATION.md`](APPLICATION-INTEGRATION.md).
The existing-repository migration is governed by [`TRANSITION-PLAYBOOK.md`](TRANSITION-PLAYBOOK.md) and [`ARCHITECTURE-OWNERSHIP.md`](ARCHITECTURE-OWNERSHIP.md).

## 1. Canonical end-to-end architecture

![MyOwnMesh end-to-end hybrid networking architecture](diagrams/01-end-to-end-hybrid.svg)

The architecture has five cooperating mechanisms:

1. **Durable semantic state** stores and derives long-lived mesh meaning, such as Open participation, Closed governance, durable capability grants, and optional application contract facts.
2. **Signaling** moves durable facts and ephemeral transport-control messages through any suitable signaling medium.
3. **The connector runtime** performs actual networking work: discovery, candidate gathering, candidate racing, connectivity checks, relay allocation, transport handshakes, measurement, migration, and recovery.
4. **Endpoint authentication and the session broker** promote a working channel into an application-usable peer session only after exact Device authentication and current mesh policy checks.
5. **Applications** exchange payload only through a live authenticated session capability.

The causal sequence is:

```text
Durable semantic state and typed signaling
        -> bounded connector work
        -> a channel that actually passes packets
        -> fresh endpoint authentication over that channel
        -> Open or Closed policy and local-principal checks
        -> live AuthenticatedPeerSession
        -> application payload
```

No route must become a durable ledger object before the connector may try it.

## 2. Transport independence, not transport removal

![Transport independence without transport removal](diagrams/03-transport-independence.svg)

For durable semantic facts, equivalent accepted inputs produce equivalent durable state regardless of whether the bytes arrived through Nostr, mDNS, WebSocket, a signaling cache, a file, serial transport, shared storage, removable media, an optical encoding, or another suitable medium.

Formally, if two deliveries produce the same accepted durable fact set under the same context, domain rules, and verified basis, they produce the same durable derived state.

This guarantee does not claim that all media can perform every networking operation. A removable drive can convey a governance fact but cannot provide an interactive endpoint channel. A UDP path can carry real-time packets but may require additional machinery for reliable semantic exchange. Each operation uses a medium or connector profile capable of the liveness, directionality, ordering, latency, and packet behavior that operation requires.

Transport properties affect:

- availability and latency;
- NAT and firewall traversal;
- congestion and loss behavior;
- packet size and fragmentation;
- addressability and multicast capability;
- relay and migration support;
- metadata exposure;
- cost, power, and resource use.

They do not, by themselves, establish Device identity, Open participation, Closed authorization, or application authority.

## 3. Durable semantic state

The durable semantic subsystem stores only facts whose meaning must survive transport loss, process restart, reordering, duplication, and delayed delivery.

The core durable fact families are:

```text
DurableFact =
    OpenParticipation
    | ClosedGovernance
    | DurableCapabilityGrant
    | DurableCapabilityRevocation
    | OptionalApplicationContractFact
```

A concrete profile may define a smaller closed set. New fact families require an adopted typed domain definition. There is no arbitrary opaque fact body in the core.

Every durable fact has:

- one canonical encoding;
- one content-derived identifier;
- an exact author and signature;
- one exact mesh or contract context;
- exact causal dependencies where required;
- domain-defined conflict and projection rules;
- bounded shape and verification cost.

Durable state is derived by a pure function:

```text
Project(
    mesh_context,
    projection_scope,
    verified_basis,
    accepted_durable_facts
) -> DerivedDurableState
```

In this specification, **projection means deterministic semantic derivation**. It is not forecasting, route construction, topology advertisement, physical reachability, or a networking operation.

`Project` may derive:

- the local Open roster view;
- the local Closed authorization view;
- durable capability state;
- explicit ambiguity in an exclusive durable semantic cell;
- optional application contract state.

It does not derive a live route, a working socket, a current relay allocation, a congestion state, or an `Online` boolean.

### 3.1 Open

Open is permissionless self-participation.

```text
Valid self-authored OpenParticipation(Present)
    -> the author may project as an Open participant
```

No sponsor, founder, quorum, pair grant, signaling service, application, identity-count vote, proof of work, or existing participant approves the Device ID.

Resource pressure may refuse or evict local work. That is a typed resource or availability result, not an authorization denial.

### 3.2 Closed

Closed adds the exact authorization proof selected by the Closed mesh context. Closed may be fully locked down.

The Closed governance commitment may describe a threshold rule, delegation graph, multisignature policy, causal governance rule, or another reviewed decentralized proof system. It does not inherently identify a central server or online authority.

A Closed operation has authority only when the locally accepted Closed governance state proves it. A valid Device signature alone is not Closed admission.

### 3.3 Causality and conflict

Durable causality is a partial order. Two facts may be causally unrelated. Causal concurrency is not itself a conflict.

Each adopted fact domain separately classifies relevant concurrent facts as:

- **Independent**, when they affect different semantic cells.
- **Joinable**, when the domain defines an associative, commutative, and idempotent join.
- **Exclusive**, when incomparable facts compete for one singular semantic cell.

Only exclusive same-cell competitors are a no-go for singular authority. They remain explicit and fail closed until the domain-defined resolution cites the required heads.

### 3.4 Retention and compaction

The durable store need not retain complete history. It may replace resolved history with a verified, independently reopenable semantic basis that preserves:

- current durable state;
- unresolved exclusive conflicts;
- exact continuation validation required by the adopted domain;
- evidence still required by live guards or pending durable effects.

Facts continue to reference facts. A compaction base is verification evidence, not an author or causal event.

Opening stored durable state never recreates live sockets, channels, keys, reachability observations, connector objects, session handles, or resource reservations from a prior runtime.

## 4. Typed signaling

Signaling is a first-class networking mechanism. It is not merely file movement, and it is not the application data path.

Signaling carries two disjoint categories:

```text
Durable semantic exchange:
    durable signed facts
    inventories and exact dependency requests
    compacted-basis proofs where adopted

Ephemeral transport control:
    connect intent
    offers and answers
    candidates and candidate updates
    relay requests and relay responses
    cancellation and recovery hints
```

Ephemeral transport control is typed, bounded, context-associated where known, and unavailable to ordinary application payload APIs. It is not required to be content-addressed, retained forever, compacted, or projected as durable state.

A signaling message may be authenticated early, late, or not at all depending on its type and connector profile. Lack of early authentication limits the effect to bounded speculative work. It cannot create durable authority or an application session.

Signaling carriers may cache, delay, duplicate, reorder, censor, or reveal control information. Those behaviors affect availability and metadata exposure. They do not replace durable fact validation or endpoint authentication.

## 5. Connector runtime and speculative transport work

The connector owns pathfinding and packet transport. It may start useful work before endpoint identity and Closed authorization are fully proven.

![Usability-first pathfinding with a strict channel-promotion boundary](diagrams/02-channel-promotion-boundary.svg)

An untrusted hint or partially authenticated signal may create only lease-backed speculative state, such as:

```text
ConnectorCandidateCapability
TransportHandle
RelayAllocationToken
ConnectedChannelCapability
TransportObservation
```

The connector may:

- gather local and remote candidates;
- probe addresses;
- open or accept sockets;
- allocate bounded TURN or member-relay state;
- race candidates;
- perform a transport handshake;
- measure whether packets pass;
- detect failure and clean up.

Those actions are real networking work. Preventing them until the full semantic proof completes would make the network slower and less usable without strengthening endpoint identity.

Before promotion, speculative work may not:

- mutate Open or Closed durable authority;
- expose an authenticated peer-session handle;
- deliver application payload to a consumer;
- send application payload as an authenticated peer;
- select arbitrary relay destinations;
- retain protected state or schedule protected work without a live resource lease.

MyOwnMesh does not maintain a parallel global route table. A connector may keep local ephemeral candidate and channel indexes for operation and diagnostics. Those local identifiers are not ledger facts, peer identity, application authority, or cross-runtime route identifiers.

### 5.1 Attempt, connector, and resource cardinality

One connection attempt is a cancellation, race, and aggregate-resource owner. It may own several connector candidates. One WebRTC connector candidate owns exactly one `RTCPeerConnection` and its one ICE agent. That ICE agent may gather, receive, and check many internal ICE candidates and candidate pairs.

These relationships describe ownership, not product-wide maximum counts. Basal MyOwnMesh defines no fixed semantic ceiling for Mesh runtimes, peers, attempts, sessions, or real-time flows. A finite host still has finite resources, so creating any of these objects is fallible. Admission succeeds only when the applicable resource provider grants the object's finite composite claim. Refusal is typed resource pressure or unavailability, never an Open or Closed authorization result.

```text
host or process resource provider
    -> grants finite ResourceLease for an exact ResourceClaim
    -> process resource root
        -> Mesh resource scope
            -> attempt, candidate, callback, cleanup, and flow owners

sum of live and failed-cleanup-retained claims in each resource dimension
    <= resource grant currently assigned to the process
```

Mesh scopes attribute use to one finite process grant. Creating another Mesh scope does not create capacity. The basal provider is shared and work-conserving, with no weights, quotas, reserved shares, or partitions. Outside a selected pending turn, unused capacity is borrowable by any scope. During that turn, the provider reserves the selected demand's exact charge and leaves any capacity beyond that charge borrowable, including surplus in an overlapping resource dimension.

Under pressure, a scope may own one exact move-only pending demand. Pending demand selection follows `Cleanup > Admitted > Speculative`; after a demand resolves, equal-class selection rotates across scopes. If the selected demand cannot fit, the provider may request retirement from exact owners of reclaimable `Speculative` leases. That request is sticky and contains no timer. It does not release, revoke, or alter a claim. The speculative owner must finish cleanup and drop its lease, or explicitly transfer the unreleased claim into failed-cleanup retention when cleanup cannot be proven.

This cooperative mechanism does not guarantee admission while capacity is held by nonreclaimable admitted work, while a speculative owner ignores its retirement request, or after cleanup failure retains the claim. Optional local policy may impose stricter cardinality or isolation ceilings for a locked-down appliance, Closed deployment, carrier cost boundary, or test, but that wrapper is not basal mesh semantics.

Resource limits have four distinct sources:

```text
Protocol-shape bound
    canonical parser or wire validity

Provider structural limit
    actual transport, codec, kernel, or hardware constraint

Runtime resource availability
    currently granted memory, handles, sockets, tasks, storage, and work

Optional local policy ceiling
    explicit administrator, cost, isolation, or compatibility restriction
```

One category cannot be presented as another. Measurements characterize cost and help select optional local policy. They do not establish a universal peer, Mesh, attempt, session, or flow count.

An exact lease is exact only for the resource units named by its claim. Native WebRTC, allocator, runtime, kernel, driver, and external relay state that the adapter cannot count remains an explicit residual. A conforming implementation must conservatively claim, isolate, or report that residual. It must not describe a visible Rust allocation or a connector-count proxy as complete native or OS accounting.

```text
one connection attempt
    -> multiple connector candidates

one WebRTC connector candidate
    -> one RTCPeerConnection and ICE agent
    -> multiple internal ICE candidates and candidate pairs

DataChannelOpen for that exact live WebRTC connector candidate
    -> ConnectedChannelCapability
    -> not endpoint authentication or session authority
```

An internal `LocalIceCandidate` is typed transport-control input to a WebRTC connector candidate. It is not a connector candidate, an attempt, or an authority capability.

### 5.2 Connector profiles

A connector profile defines the transport-specific work it performs, including:

- candidate discovery and accepted hints;
- connectivity checks and nomination;
- relay allocation;
- packet and stream behavior;
- congestion and flow control;
- migration and recovery;
- live observations and failure reports;
- resource claims.

Profiles may include:

```text
Direct LAN
ICE with STUN and TURN
Generic opaque endpoint relay
Closed member relay
QUIC-native transport
Serial or radio transport
Future non-IP transport
```

A common connector interface does not erase their real operational differences.

## 6. Channel promotion and endpoint session

A working channel is not yet an authenticated peer session.

A channel may be promoted only when:

```text
MayPromoteChannel(channel) :=
    ChannelCurrentlyWorks(channel)
    and FreshMutualDeviceAuthentication(channel)
    and ExactMeshContextBinding(channel)
    and ApplicableOpenOrClosedPolicyAllowsPeer
    and AuthenticatedLocalPrincipalAllowsUse
    and PostAuthenticationResourcesReserved
```

Fresh endpoint authentication binds both Device identities and the exact mesh context to the channel that actually passed traffic. The selected endpoint-authentication profile must prevent replay of an old transcript onto another channel and must derive fresh traffic protection for that channel or session.

The result is a local opaque capability:

```text
AuthenticatedPeerSession {
    opaque_handle_capability,
    mesh_context,
    local_device_id,
    remote_device_id
}
```

Internally, the capability is bound to:

- the authenticated channel or authenticated live-channel set;
- the endpoint-authentication transcript;
- the authenticated local principal;
- current Open or Closed policy state;
- current resource reservations;
- one live runtime incarnation.

It is not reconstructed from stored records, a session number, a route identifier, or a serialized handle.

Every application send, receive, callback, and recovery action rechecks the live capability and current guards.

## 7. Carriers and relays

A session may use:

```text
DirectEndpointCarrier
TurnCarrier
GenericOpaqueRelayCarrier
ClosedMemberRelayCarrier
```

All carriers preserve the same endpoint relationship:

```text
AuthenticatedPeerSession(A, C)
```

Carrier choice changes latency, loss, cost, metadata exposure, and availability. It does not change A or C's Device identity or application authority.

### 7.1 Closed member relay

A Closed member B may offer an explicit bounded relay function for A and C. B remains visibly Device B. Anonymous attestation is neither required nor desirable.

A basal Closed member-relay allocation requires:

- current Closed authorization for the endpoints and B under the local accepted view;
- a valid current relay offer or capability for B under the selected Closed profile;
- local relay policy at A, B, and C;
- one exact A-C allocation with bounded resources;
- fixed endpoints and no arbitrary host, port, fanout, or recursive relay destination;
- fresh A-C endpoint authentication through the resulting channel.

B may authenticate relay setup with its ordinary Device identity or through an already authenticated Device channel. A separate operational relay key is optional private-key custody hardening. It remains visible and explicitly delegated by B. It is not an anonymous credential or another authority root.

B may drop, delay, reorder, meter, or correlate opaque traffic and observe carrier metadata. Under the endpoint cryptographic premises, B cannot authenticate as A or C, read A-C application plaintext, or forge accepted A-C application packets.

A relay may be tried immediately, raced with direct and TURN candidates, retained as backup, or preferred by local policy. It need not be a last resort and no exhaustive candidate search is a security prerequisite.

## 8. Recovery and handoff

![Closed member relay and endpoint-driven handoff](diagrams/04-closed-member-relay-handoff.svg)

Handoff is endpoint-driven and live. It does not require a durable `PathOffer`, `PathAccept`, `PathID`, `PathRetire`, a monotonic path generation, a globally current route, or relay-to-relay signaling.

If A and C are using B and the connector finds D:

1. Keep B active.
2. Attempt D under the speculative-work budget.
3. Establish a working candidate channel through D.
4. Perform fresh A-C endpoint authentication or current-session key confirmation bound to that exact channel.
5. Add the authenticated D channel to the local usable-channel set.
6. Select D according to local path policy.
7. Close B when policy and in-flight work permit.

An attacker may drop B and thereby trigger failover policy. That is availability influence. The attacker cannot make D application-usable without the endpoint authentication and promotion predicates.

Old signaling or handoff messages may cause bounded duplicate candidate work. They cannot recreate a live channel capability, endpoint-authentication result, packet key, replay state, or session handle.

No simultaneous global switch is required. A and C may temporarily send over different authenticated channels or keep more than one authenticated channel active.

## 9. Reachability and freshness

Reachability is a local evidence vector, not a durable global fact.

A useful view may include:

```text
PeerReachabilityView {
    durable_participation_or_authorization_state,
    signaling_response_observation,
    candidate_and_channel_observations,
    authenticated_session_state,
    local_observation_ages
}
```

Evidence strength for current application reachability is approximately:

```text
fresh authenticated session traffic
    stronger than
fresh endpoint-authenticated channel confirmation
    stronger than
fresh transport connectivity check
    stronger than
fresh signed presence response
    stronger than
receipt of cached durable state
```

Freshness is computed from local monotonic observation time. A remote or carrier timestamp does not establish local freshness.

A failed probe or expired observation means `Unknown` or `FailedObservation`. It does not synthesize withdrawal, removal, or application denial.

## 10. Signaling and application payload boundary

The signaling and payload message spaces are disjoint.

- Durable facts contain no application-payload variant.
- Ephemeral transport-control messages contain no generic application bytes.
- Signaling caches do not forward application packets.
- A connector callback cannot directly deliver application payload before channel promotion.
- Application payload requires a live `AuthenticatedPeerSession` capability.

Physical multiplexing does not alter this rule. Signaling, relay control, endpoint authentication, and application packets may share a process, host, socket, or lower transport where a profile permits it, but immutable message classification, parser dispatch, keys, capabilities, queues, and effects remain non-substitutable.

An intentional application intermediary is different. If B terminates an A-B application session, processes plaintext, and authors a new B-C application operation, B is an explicit application endpoint. That is not transparent MyOwnMesh relay behavior.

## 11. Application and session-data-plane boundary

Applications request an exact mesh context and remote Device ID. They do not construct durable facts, transport-control messages, candidates, routes, relay allocations, or endpoint-authentication transcripts.

MyOwnMesh returns:

- a derived roster view;
- bounded reachability observations;
- a live authenticated peer-session capability;
- typed session lifecycle and diagnostics;
- optional connector-native data-plane capabilities bound to that live session.

The basal architecture does not define a `MediaLane`, video lane, audio lane, fixed codec, or fixed lane count. A connector may provide a native real-time flow mechanism, such as WebRTC RTP tracks, because transport-specific low-latency delivery is part of useful networking. MyOwnMesh owns binding that flow to the authenticated session, lifecycle, resource limits, backpressure, and safe delivery. The application owns codec choice, frame format, media purpose, track naming, screen/camera/audio meaning, composition, and product policy.

A connector may provision native track objects before promotion under the bounded speculative-work rules. No encoded frame reaches an application, and no application frame is sent, until the associated session capability is live. Connector-native flow support is optional. A data-only connector remains conforming.

Application authorization begins after session promotion. A mesh session proves the exact peer and context. It does not automatically grant a screen, file, camera, terminal, command, or other application capability.

## 12. Optional causal contracts

The durable semantic subsystem may host reviewed typed application contract domains. Those domains may add consensus, total ordering, blocks, replicated execution, threshold authorization, or economic mechanisms when their application semantics require them.

Those mechanisms remain optional and domain-confined. They do not serialize ordinary pathfinding, reachability, relay allocation, packet carriage, or unrelated mesh facts.

MyOwnMesh is therefore not a transport-removed ledger and not a blockchain-shaped network base. It is a usable hybrid network whose durable semantic component can also support causal contracts.

## 13. Hard architectural invariants

1. **Transport does work but does not create authority.** Transport hints and channels may drive bounded networking work. Device identity and mesh authority still require their exact proofs.
2. **Security gates promotion, not path discovery.** A candidate may be attempted before endpoint authentication. Application use may not.
3. **Open remains open.** Any authentic Device ID may self-participate under the Open rules.
4. **Closed alone adds governance authorization.** Closed can be fully locked down under its selected proof system.
5. **Durable facts and ephemeral transport control are distinct.** Only genuinely persistent meaning enters the durable semantic store.
6. **Projection is durable semantic derivation only.** It does not create or forecast routes.
7. **No route ledger is required.** Candidate, route, channel, and handoff state are live connector state unless a separate application domain explicitly chooses otherwise.
8. **A working socket is not a session.** Endpoint authentication, mesh policy, local principal, and resources are required for promotion.
9. **Carrier is not peer identity.** Direct, TURN, generic relay, and Closed member relay preserve the same authenticated endpoint relationship.
10. **No anonymous member relay.** A Closed member relay is visibly attributable to its Device identity.
11. **No relay-authorized handoff.** Relays cannot add, select, or retire an application-usable channel.
12. **Signaling and payload remain disjoint.** No ordinary application path can use signaling as a generic message bus.
13. **Reachability is positive local evidence.** Absence or expiry is not revocation.
14. **Work owns resources before use.** Every protected allocation, retained value, task, queue entry, native object, and scheduled work unit holds a live finite lease from the applicable provider.
15. **Semantic cardinality remains open.** Basal MyOwnMesh has no fixed maximum Mesh, peer, attempt, session, or flow count. Admission follows actual resource claims and current provider availability.
16. **Resource scopes do not mint capacity.** Child scopes share one finite process grant with no basal weights, quotas, shares, or partitions. A selected pending turn reserves only its exact charge, and surplus capacity remains borrowable. Pending demand uses `Cleanup > Admitted > Speculative` authority order and equal-class per-scope rotation. The provider may request exact reclaimable Speculative owners to retire, but the request changes no claim. Capacity becomes reusable only after owner Drop following cleanup. Failed cleanup transfers the exact charge into retention. Nonreclaimable admitted pressure, ignored retirement, and failed cleanup can still prevent admission.
17. **Time is not resource truth.** A slow operation may retain its finite lease indefinitely. Elapsed time alone cannot create, release, or invalidate resources or authority.
18. **One reducer and session broker own promotion and semantic effects.** Adapters and callbacks cannot bypass the guards.
19. **Complete eclipse is not claimed solved.** A carrier can withhold information and deny availability, but cannot forge the missing proofs.

## 14. Owner decisions that remain explicit

Owner review must select and test:

1. Device ID, Mesh ID, and exact mesh-context encodings.
2. Canonical durable-fact encoding, hash, signature profile, and test vectors.
3. The Closed governance proof, conflict, recovery, and compaction rules.
4. The durable fact families and optional application contract domains in each profile.
5. The supported signaling carriers and ephemeral transport-control schemas.
6. Connector profiles and required egress environments.
7. Endpoint-authentication and channel-binding protocols.
8. Direct, TURN, generic relay, and Closed member-relay requirements.
9. Resource-provider integration, provider structural limits, and any optional local resource ceilings.
10. Reachability observation and local path-selection policies.
11. Session-handle sharing, recovery, and application lifecycle behavior.
12. Measurements used for performance characterization, provider-cost estimation, regression detection, opaque-allocation discovery, and optional deployment policy.

No numeric product cardinality is inferred from a plausible default. Any numeric protocol or provider limit must be proven by that protocol or provider. Any optional local ceiling requires explicit owner selection.
