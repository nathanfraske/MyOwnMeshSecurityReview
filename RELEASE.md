# Releases

Cutting a release:

```
just release 0.2.8
```

That recipe:

1. Bumps the version in every manifest that pins it via
   `scripts/bump-version.sh` — root `Cargo.toml`
   (`[workspace.package].version` + the matching pins under
   `[workspace.dependencies]`), `gui/src-tauri/Cargo.toml`,
   `gui/src-tauri/Cargo.lock`, and `gui/package.json`.
2. Refreshes the root `Cargo.lock`.
3. Commits the version bumps, pushes the branch, then triggers
   `release.yml` via `gh workflow run` with `tag=v0.2.8`.

The release workflow runs on `push: tags: v*` and on
`workflow_dispatch` (which is what step 3 uses), then for each of
`linux-x86_64`, `linux-aarch64`, `macos-aarch64`, `macos-x86_64`,
`windows-x86_64`:

- Verifies the tag matches every manifest version (catches the
  case where a maintainer pushed a tag without running
  `just release`).
- Builds the headless `myownmesh` daemon and packages it as
  `myownmesh-<platform>.{tar.gz,zip}` + `.sha256` sidecar.
- Builds the Tauri GUI bundle (.deb / .AppImage / .dmg / .msi /
  .exe) via `tauri-action`.
- Packages the portable `myownmesh-gui` binary as
  `myownmesh-gui-<platform>.{tar.gz,zip}` + `.sha256` so the
  `curl | sh` installer can drop it next to the daemon (a bare
  `myownmesh` then opens the GUI).
- Uploads everything to the GitHub release.

Two extra **daemon-only** jobs run outside that matrix, building
fully static musl binaries for the KVM appliances (no GUI, no glibc
dependency): `daemon-riscv64` → `myownmesh-linux-riscv64.tar.gz`
(NanoKVM) and `daemon-aarch64-musl` →
`myownmesh-linux-aarch64-musl.tar.gz` (NanoKVM-Pro). Both are
cross-compiled with `cargo-zigbuild`. Note the `-musl` suffix on the
aarch64 appliance asset: the plain `myownmesh-linux-aarch64.tar.gz`
is the dynamic-glibc **desktop** build, so the appliance name must
not collide with it. See [`docs/NANOKVM.md`](docs/NANOKVM.md).

The matrix mirrors MyOwnLLM's `release.yml` so behaviour is
consistent across both apps.

## What's published, what isn't

| Artifact | Where | Audience |
|---|---|---|
| `myownmesh-<platform>.{tar.gz,zip}` + `.sha256` | [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh/releases) | End users running the headless daemon; the self-updater consumes the same artifacts. |
| `myownmesh-gui-<platform>.{tar.gz,zip}` + `.sha256` | GitHub Releases | The shell installer drops this next to the daemon so a bare `myownmesh` opens the GUI. The self-updater keeps it in lockstep with the daemon (it swaps this binary too when one is installed beside `myownmesh`). Lightweight (relies on the system webview); the OS bundles below are the full desktop install. |
| Tauri GUI bundles (`.deb` / `.AppImage` / `.dmg` / `.msi` / `.exe`) | GitHub Releases | End users who want the desktop app with full OS integration. |
| `myownmesh-core`, `myownmesh-signaling`, `myownmesh-updater` source | Git tag `vX.Y.Z` | Embedders, via `git = …, tag = "vX.Y.Z"` in their `Cargo.toml`. |

The three library crates are **not on crates.io yet** — embedders
pull them as git dependencies pinned to a release tag. The first
crates.io publish is gated on a public-API freeze; until then the
git-tag pin is the supported integration path (and gives downstream
projects exact reproducibility because the tag content is
immutable).

The order of operations to add crates.io later is straightforward —
`cargo publish -p myownmesh-signaling` first, then `-p myownmesh-core`
(which depends on signaling), then `-p myownmesh-updater` (depends on
core), then `-p myownmesh` (depends on all three). The workspace
dependency table already pins each inter-crate edge with `version =
"X.Y.Z"` alongside the path entry, which is exactly the shape
`cargo publish` requires. When the time comes, add `cargo publish`
steps to `release.yml` after the GitHub-release upload.

## Versioning

Semver. `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`:

- **PATCH**: bug fixes, no protocol changes, no API changes that
  break embedders.
- **MINOR**: new optional protocol message kinds (added to the
  `features` matrix so older peers ignore them), new public API
  surface (additive), new config fields with defaults.
- **MAJOR**: incompatible protocol shape change (bumps
  `PROTOCOL_VERSION`), removed / renamed public API, removed
  config keys.

`PROTOCOL_VERSION` is at the wire-protocol layer; embedders that
pin a specific MyOwnMesh version don't need to track it. Bumping
the workspace version doesn't automatically bump the protocol
version.

## Updater channels

The self-updater hits one of two URLs:

- `auto_update.stable_url` (or `MYOWNMESH_RELEASE_URL_STABLE` if
  unset): `https://api.github.com/repos/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh/releases/latest`
- `auto_update.beta_url` (or `MYOWNMESH_RELEASE_URL_BETA`):
  `https://api.github.com/repos/mrjeeves/MyOwnMesh/releases`

Override either to host your own release feed (forks, internal
fleets).

## Apply policy

Configured via `auto_update.auto_apply`:

- `patch`: auto-apply patch bumps only (`0.1.5 → 0.1.6`).
- `minor`: auto-apply patch + minor (`0.1.5 → 0.2.0` ok).
- `all`: apply any version bump.
- `none`: stage updates but require a manual `myownmesh update apply`.

Package-manager installs (Homebrew / apt / rpm / MSI / choco) are
detected on first launch and self-update is skipped — the OS
package manager stays the source of truth.

## What updates

A release bumps the daemon (`myownmesh`) and the desktop GUI
(`myownmesh-gui`) together. The self-updater keeps **both** current:
when it stages an update it stages the GUI binary too, as long as one
is installed beside the daemon (the portable `curl | sh` layout), and
the next launch swaps both. This is what keeps the GUI's window title
from lagging behind the daemon it spawns.

A headless box with no GUI updates the daemon alone. A full desktop
bundle (macOS `.app` / `.dmg`, Linux `.deb` / `.AppImage`, Windows
`.msi`) is owned by its own installer and is left untouched — same
rule as a package-manager install.

## Updating by hand

```
myownmesh update
```

Fetches the latest release and updates everything (daemon + GUI) in one
shot — the equivalent of MyOwnLLM's `myownllm update`. It ignores the
`auto_apply` policy and the check interval (you asked for it), but still
defers to the OS package manager. Restart MyOwnMesh afterwards to run
the new binaries.

The granular subcommands remain for scripting and inspection:

- `myownmesh update check` — check the feed now and stage any permitted
  update (respects `auto_apply`).
- `myownmesh update apply` — apply what's already staged.
- `myownmesh update status` — version, channel, policy, last check, staged.
- `myownmesh update enable` / `disable` — toggle background checks.

## Forking

If you're maintaining a fork that publishes its own releases:

1. Set `MYOWNMESH_RELEASE_URL_STABLE` / `_BETA` at build time to
   your release feed.
2. Set `MYOWNMESH_TRYSTERO_APP_ID` to a fork-specific app id so
   your peers land in their own signaling rooms.
3. Update `ENDPOINT_AUTH_DOMAIN_TAG` in
   `crates/myownmesh-core/src/endpoint_auth/mod.rs` if the fork must use a
   deliberately incompatible endpoint-authentication transcript domain.
