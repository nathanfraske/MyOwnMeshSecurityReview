//! Daemon process lifecycle. The GUI works against a running
//! `myownmesh serve`; if one isn't already listening when we start
//! up, we spawn one as a child process and hold the handle for the
//! lifetime of the app. Killing the GUI also kills the child via
//! `DaemonChild::Drop`.
//!
//! Binary discovery order:
//!
//! 1. `MYOWNMESH_BIN` environment variable (manual override).
//! 2. Workspace dev artefacts relative to the GUI crate:
//!    `../../target/debug/myownmesh{.exe}` then `../../target/release/...`.
//!    In a source checkout this is the binary you just built, so it must
//!    win over any older release installed on `$PATH` — otherwise
//!    `just dev` would run the GUI you just compiled against a stale
//!    daemon (e.g. one that predates the `services` control ops, which
//!    surfaces as "is the daemon running?" in the Services tab). On an
//!    installed GUI this path doesn't exist, so we fall through to PATH.
//! 3. `myownmesh` (or `myownmesh.exe`) on `$PATH` (the production path).
//!
//! If we already see an existing daemon answering on the control
//! socket, we don't spawn a second one — the user may have started
//! it manually, and binding twice would just trip the second
//! instance up. The first listener wins; subsequent ones bail.
