# Hosted services

A MyOwnMesh device can host infrastructure for the rest of the mesh:
a signaling server, a STUN server, and a TURN server. Turning these on lets
a device advertise itself as a signaling, address-discovery, or ICE relay
service, which is what makes a
**fully internet-isolated network** practical. No Google STUN, no
Cloudflare TURN, no public Nostr relay required: one always-on device
(or a few) can supply every piece of plumbing a closed fleet needs.

A device is **any combination** of a mesh node and these hosted
services. A dedicated box can be pure infrastructure (signaling +
STUN + TURN, not itself a member). The hosted services are **off by
default** and configured device-wide (not per network); a hosted service
serves every network the device participates in, plus any external client
that points at it. The `node` role is **on by default** (a fresh device
is a normal member).

## The services

| Service | What it does | Default | Needs |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Node** | Participate as a regular mesh member (join configured networks). On by default; off = pure-infra box. | on | nothing |
| **LegacyV1 member relay** | Frozen application-frame forwarding for pre-V4 deployments. This is not TURN or signaling. | unavailable in normal V4 builds | `legacy-v1`, explicit legacy daemon option, node on |
| **Signaling** | An *intelligent* Nostr relay (NIP-01 / WebSocket) peers use in place of public Nostr, with live presence, instant departure, and flood limits. | off · :4848 | nothing |
| **STUN** | Answers RFC 5389 binding requests so peers learn their reflexive address. | off · :3478 | nothing |
| **TURN** | Relays media / data for peers behind symmetric NAT (RFC 5766), with an optional per-connection bandwidth cap. | off · :3478 | public IP + credentials |

### Node

Whether this device participates as a regular mesh member by joining its
configured networks and acting as a peer. It's on by default. Turn it off
to run a **pure-infrastructure box**: the daemon hosts signaling / STUN /
TURN (advertising itself purely as an edge / ingress-egress point) and
joins no networks itself. The frozen LegacyV1 member relay is different: it
requires node participation because it forwards application frames between
members.

Toggling `node` live joins or leaves every configured network in place;
no restart needed.

### LegacyV1 member relay

This section describes frozen pre-V4 compatibility. Normal V4 startup rejects
the old `services.relay` configuration. A retained compatibility build must
enable the `legacy-v1` feature and start the daemon with `--legacy-v1`.

When enabled, the device forwards typed-channel frames between roster
members on a reserved channel. A spoke sends a `RelayEnvelope`
(`{ dst, payload }`) to the relay; the relay rewrites the authenticated
origin into `src` and forwards it to one destination (directed) or to
every other reachable member (broadcast, `dst` empty).

Forwarding is **roster-gated on both ends**: a frame is only relayed when
its sender is an approved peer of the relay device, and a directed frame
only reaches its destination when that destination is also approved. The
relay never forwards for or to strangers.

This is application-frame routing built on the old channel API. It is not a
V4 connector feature, TURN, signaling, or a generic relay. New V4 code must
not use it. It remains only while downstream applications migrate.

### Signaling

A self-hosted [Nostr](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips) relay
speaking the slice of NIP-01 the mesh needs (`REQ` / `EVENT` / `EOSE` /
`CLOSE`, with `kinds` / `since` / `#tag` filters). The win is that the
built-in signaling driver **already speaks NIP-01 to public relays**, so
a peer adopts your relay with zero client changes. Add
`ws://your-host:4848` to that network's signaling servers (see
*Pointing peers at your services* below).

Presence events (kind `1077`) are retained for ~15 minutes so a late
joiner discovers everyone already in the room; negotiation events
(ephemeral kind `21077`) are forwarded live and never stored, so a stale
offer can't bind a fresh connection. The relay does not verify event
signatures. It is a forwarder, and the mesh runs its own ed25519 mutual
auth over the resulting WebRTC channel, so a forged Nostr event buys an
attacker nothing but a failed handshake.

#### Intelligent coordination

A self-hosted relay is *stateful*, the way a normal WebRTC signaling
server is. It does more than blindly forward, which makes connections
come up faster and recover quicker. All of it stays plain NIP-01 on the
wire and **degrades gracefully**: against a public relay (or an older
peer) you simply get the dumb-forwarder baseline.

- **Live presence.** The relay learns `(connection → device, room)` from
  the announces a peer publishes, so it knows who's actually connected
  *now*. A peer subscribing gets the live member set replayed instantly,
  near-instant discovery, even if a member's last announce is old.
- **Instant departure.** When a member's socket closes, the relay emits a
  `leave` to the room. The engine already understands "peer left" and
  tears the connection down immediately, instead of waiting out the
  ~75 s heartbeat timeout. (This is a brand-new `SignalingMessage::Leave`
  the smart relay synthesizes; public relays never send it, so a peer
  that doesn't get one just falls back to timeout detection.)

These accelerate the engine's existing reconnection ladder rather than
replacing it. The relay is an **optional accelerator, never a
coordinator the mesh depends on**. If it goes away, peers fall back to
the public-Nostr behaviour and the mesh keeps working.

#### Flood limits

Because this is meant to be safe to stand up publicly, every connection
is rate-limited and the relay sheds abuse. All limits are tunable
(`services.signaling.limits`), and `0` means "no limit":

| Limit | Default | Guards against |
|---|---|---|
| `max_event_rate` | 50 / s / conn | publish floods |
| `max_req_rate` | 20 / s / conn | subscription churn |
| `max_subscriptions` | 64 / conn | subscription hoarding |
| `max_filters_per_req` | 16 | oversized `REQ`s |
| `max_message_bytes` | 65536 | giant frames |
| `max_connections_per_ip` | 64 | connection storms |

Rates use a token bucket (1-second burst); a connection that keeps
violating limits accrues strikes and is disconnected with a `NOTICE`.

### STUN

A standalone STUN server: it answers binding requests with the source's
XOR-mapped address and does nothing else. It is pure reflexion, with no auth or
allocations. Peers add `stun:your-host:3478` to a network's STUN servers.

### TURN

A full TURN server (via the webrtc-rs `turn` crate) for peers behind
symmetric NAT, where a direct path can't be punched. TURN needs three
things that STUN/signaling don't:

- **A public IP** (`public_ip`), the routable address the server hands
  out in relay allocations. It can't guess this; if the bind address is a
  wildcard (`0.0.0.0`) you *must* set it, or TURN refuses to start.
- **At least one credential**, a username / password pair. Mirror the
  same pair into each peer's TURN config. Enabled without credentials,
  TURN shows as *enabled, not running*.
- **Open UDP ports, the one that bites people.** `:3478` is only the
  *control* channel; every relayed allocation flows through a *separate*
  UDP port. By default the server draws those from the **OS ephemeral
  range** (so the relay is never artificially capped). On Linux, that is
  `sysctl net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`, e.g. Ubuntu's `32768–60999`.
  Open `udp 3478` **and that whole range**:

      sudo ufw allow 3478/udp
      sudo ufw allow 32768:60999/udp     # your sysctl range

  **All of it must be open at the host firewall AND your cloud/provider
  security group**. A host firewall being inactive (`ufw status` →
  `inactive`) does **not** mean the provider lets them in. The classic
  failure is opening only 443 for the signaling proxy and then seeing
  `0 srflx · 0 relay` candidates on every client. To shrink the firewall
  surface, pin a fixed window via `relay_port_min` / `relay_port_max`
  (e.g. `49152`–`65535`) and open only that. `myownmesh ctl services
  enable turn` prints the right checklist either way.

A TURN server also answers STUN binding requests, so enabling TURN gives
you STUN for free on the same port. You rarely need both the STUN and
TURN services on one host. (So `stun:` and `turn:` URLs can point at the
same host:3478.)

**Bandwidth cap (QoS).** `max_bps_per_connection` shapes each
allocation's relayed throughput to a byte/sec ceiling, applied
independently in each direction (`0` = unlimited). It is a global knob:
every allocation gets the same cap, with no per-user override yet, so
one client can't saturate the relay. It's enforced by a token bucket on
each allocation's relay socket; because the data is UDP, exceeding the
cap creates backpressure and drops rather than unbounded buffering, which
is the honest QoS behaviour for a relay.

## Configuration

Services live under `services` in `~/.myownmesh/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "services": {
    "node":      { "enabled": true },
    "relay":     { "enabled": false, "max_fanout": 0 },
    "signaling": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bind": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 4848,
      "limits": {
        "max_event_rate": 50,
        "max_req_rate": 20,
        "max_subscriptions": 64,
        "max_filters_per_req": 16,
        "max_message_bytes": 65536,
        "max_connections_per_ip": 64
      }
    },
    "stun":      { "enabled": true, "bind": "0.0.0.0", "port": 3478 },
    "turn": {
      "enabled": true,
      "bind": "0.0.0.0",
      "port": 3478,
      "public_ip": "203.0.113.7",
      "realm": "myownmesh",
      "credentials": [ { "username": "alice", "password": "s3cret" } ],
      "max_bps_per_connection": 0
    }
  },
  "networks": []
}
```

Changes are picked up three ways, all equivalent:

### GUI

**Settings → Services.** Each service has a toggle and its fields; TURN
adds credential management. A live status pill shows whether each
listener is actually running (a service can be *enabled* but fail to
start, such as when a port is already in use or TURN has no credentials). Edits
are staged; **Apply changes** persists them and reconciles the running
services.

### CLI

```sh
# Show what's hosted and where it's listening.
myownmesh ctl services status

# Toggle a normal V4 service: node | signaling | stun | turn.
myownmesh ctl services enable signaling
myownmesh ctl services disable stun

# Turn this box into pure infrastructure (no mesh membership):
myownmesh ctl services disable node
```

`enable` / `disable` flip just the one flag and persist. TURN credentials
+ public IP and the signaling flood limits / TURN bandwidth cap can't be
set from the CLI toggle. Edit `config.json` or use the GUI for those;
an enabled-but-unconfigured TURN shows as *not running* in
`services status`.

### Editing config.json directly

Edit the `services` block and restart the daemon (`myownmesh serve`), or
re-apply live via the GUI / CLI.

## Discovery: advertising and adopting services

When a device hosts a service it advertises a **service role** to peers
via the capability matrix. Normal V4 roles use the stable tags
`service:signaling`, `service:stun`, and `service:turn`, which ride in the
`hello` handshake every peer already exchanges. A peer can therefore see
"this device is a TURN handler" with no wire-format change.

When the device also knows its own reachable address (it uses the TURN
`public_ip` as the host hint), it additionally advertises concrete
endpoint URLs in a structured `services` blob inside its capability
`extra`:

```json
{ "services": {
    "signaling_url": "ws://203.0.113.7:4848",
    "stun_url": "stun:203.0.113.7:3478",
    "turn_url": "turn:203.0.113.7:3478",
    "relay": false
} }
```

The wire field `relay` and tag `service:relay` are frozen LegacyV1 names for
the ordinary-member application relay. Their source role is
`LegacyV1MemberRelay`. They do not describe TURN, signaling, or a generic
opaque relay.

A peer reads this with `ServiceAdvert::from_extra(...)` and can drop the
URLs straight into its own network config.

### Pointing peers at your services

On each peer, edit the network's transport config to use your host
instead of (or alongside) the public defaults:

- **Signaling** → set the network's `signaling.servers` to
  `["ws://your-host:4848"]`. A non-empty list takes full precedence over
  the built-in public-relay pool, so this is how you cut a network off
  from public Nostr entirely.
- **STUN** → add `{ "urls": ["stun:your-host:3478"] }` to
  `stun_servers` (write an explicit `[]` first if you want *only* your
  STUN).
- **TURN** → add
  `{ "urls": ["turn:your-host:3478"], "username": "alice", "credential": "s3cret" }`
  to `turn_servers`.

In the GUI these live under a network's gear icon → **Settings**
(signaling relays / STUN / TURN editors). Once every member points at one
self-hosted device for signaling + TURN, the network needs nothing
outside its own walls.

## Running a public relay

The signaling relay is built to be safe to stand up publicly (that's what
the flood limits are for). Three deployment realities to get right:

### 1. It serves plain `ws://`; terminate TLS in front of it

The relay speaks plain WebSocket; it has **no built-in TLS**. The built-in
default relay list uses `wss://`, and port 443 also sails through
restrictive firewalls that block oddball ports. A public endpoint
wants a TLS-terminating reverse proxy on **443** that forwards the
WebSocket upgrade to the relay on loopback.

One command installs Caddy if needed, writes the
site block, binds the relay to loopback, and (re)starts the Caddy
service:

```
myownmesh install caddy relay.example.com
```

It generates a Caddy site that proxies **only** WebSocket upgrades to the
relay and answers everything else (browsers, scanners, health checks)
with a plain 200, so stray hits don't pile up as 502s in the log:

```
relay.example.com {
    @ws {
        header Connection *Upgrade*
        header Upgrade websocket
    }
    handle @ws {
        reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:4848
    }
    handle {
        respond "MyOwnMesh signaling relay; connect over wss://" 200
    }
}
```

Doing it by hand with nginx instead:

```
location / {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4848;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
```

Peers then point at `wss://relay.example.com` (no port because it uses 443). Open **80
and 443** at the firewall (Caddy needs 80 for the ACME challenge) and keep
the relay's own port (4848) on loopback. `install caddy` sets
`services.signaling.bind` to `127.0.0.1` for you, so the only public door
is the TLS one.

### 2. Give it its own hostname

If a name is a static site (GitHub Pages, etc.) its DNS points at the
static host, not your relay box. `wss://that-name` hits the site, not the
relay. Run the relay on a server you control and point a **dedicated
subdomain** (e.g. `relay.example.com`) at it.

> Point peers at the **relay's** host, not a static site. The project's
> own site `myownmesh.net` is GitHub Pages and cannot host a WebSocket
> server, so `wss://myownmesh.net` would hit the site, not a relay.
> `myownmesh.com` is the relay (a server running the Caddy proxy above).
> Give your own relay a host or subdomain that resolves to the box it
> runs on.

### 3. Verify traffic is actually arriving

The relay logs every connection and a periodic heartbeat at `info`, and
`ctl services status` reports live counts, so you can tell "nobody's
reaching me" from "I'm broken":

```
$ myownmesh ctl services status        # the signaling.activity block
{ "connections": 2, "connections_total": 5, "rooms": 1, "events_relayed": 42 }
```

In the daemon log, per peer plus a 5-minute heartbeat:

```
INFO signaling: client connected     ip=… active=1
INFO signaling: client disconnected  ip=… active=0
INFO signaling: relay activity       connections=2 rooms=1 events_relayed=42
```

If you see `listening` but **never** a `client connected` (and
`connections` stays `0`) while peers are trying, the relay is fine. The
traffic isn't arriving. Check, in order: **DNS** (does the hostname
resolve to this box?), **TLS / proxy** (is the proxy upgrading
WebSockets?), then **firewall** (is the port open?).
