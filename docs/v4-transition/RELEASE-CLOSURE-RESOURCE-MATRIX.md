# V4 release-closure resource matrix

Status: exact source-publication ledger for review `5058637044`, bound to
source head `de82d6be101b2d67919258f7b66ec76cad27f674`, tree
`4a3da93b0f0d4a7ea9da6c707d7fb178d71e7ff1`, parent
`7226f2d74720c2fbfea317ba1e59899877aaa46d`, and the recorded delta of 8
paths (`+708/-105`). Manifest SHA256 is
`3ee15225c56ff20ab499286d951bd478a4efea2d1b3376387c214c3489e78ca8`.
Hosted CI `33323693733`, attempt 1, completed successfully for all six jobs.
Manager-owned local evidence is check `4e9f0f65`, Clippy `74a9f245`, fmt
`26f4db17`, and full workspace `e1d7a79b`. These identifiers are publication
evidence, not new capacity or performance promises.
PR #7 remains OPEN, draft, unmerged, and on HOLD.

"Finite" below identifies a source bound, not a capacity promise or SLO. A
downstream core admission does not retroactively fund or bound bytes allocated
inside an upstream carrier library.

## Ownership matrix

## Value-origin ledger

The following table is exhaustive for the persisted `MdnsPolicyConfig` fields
and relay `Limits` fields. A default is a deserialization/configuration
default, not proof of capacity, throughput, or an SLO. Source-of-truth
anchors refer to the published source family above; bridge translation and
runtime validation are separate evidence from these declarations.

## Evidence still required

Each advertised row must ultimately bind an exact frozen SHA, configuration,
platform/toolchain, raw logs, terminal state, before/after resource baseline,
and run or artifact identifier. Refusal, cancellation, response loss,
disconnect, shutdown, and join paths must release transient custody. Pre-core
carrier bounds and joins need their own proof; a green core baseline cannot
discharge them.

The Unix MFA gate is durable state-machine evidence: Prepare persists before
response, an unread first response leaves Prepared intact, ordinary Prepare
redelivers identical material, and an exact Commit completes enrollment (or an
exact Abort removes it). There is no MFA `ProvisionalHandoff` choreography or
response-write rollback in current source.

## HOLD and non-goals

- HOLD remains until operator acceptance of frozen source, serialized Cargo,
  independent verification and audit, hosted exact-head CI, real-machine field
  qualification, firewall cleanup evidence where applicable, packaging, and
  detached performance characterization.
- This matrix creates no performance threshold, capacity/SLO, retry framework,
  package installation, firewall exception, public listener, or new manifest.
- It does not call LocalBroker a production carrier, treat carrier identity as
  governance authority, add application payload to signaling, or relabel OS,
  resolver, carrier-library, Tauri, or CI storage as core-provider funded.
- Durable MFA recovery is local custody recovery, not remote account recovery.
- Hosted CI `33323693733` attempt 1 completed successfully for all six jobs;
  field, firewall, packaging, and detached-performance qualification remain
  pending for review `5058637044`.
- Explicit ceilings remain: no real system DNS-SD daemon runtime is claimed;
  Windows feature-selector and riscv local failures are non-evidence;
  system-dnssd/iOS, field/firewall, opaque installer, detached performance,
  and packaging/repository closure remain qualified or pending as applicable.
