# Debugging connection-state reliability

A field runbook for the connection-reliability work. The engine is
heavily layered — a graduated recovery ladder, an ICE watchdog, a wake
detector, a network watcher (see the retained
[`CONNECTION-ENGINE-FIELD-NOTES.md`](../CONNECTION-ENGINE-FIELD-NOTES.md)).
When node connection state is nonetheless unreliable, the cause is
almost never a missing tier. It's one of two structural things:

1. **No single source of truth for "is this peer up."** Liveness is
   spread across several independently-updated fields — `status`,
   `tier`, the raw ICE state, the peer-connection state, the selected
   candidate pair, inbound recency. Nothing forces them to agree, so a
   peer can read `status = active` while ICE has already gone
   `Disconnected`. That disagreement *is* the bug.
2. **A detection blind spot.** A half-dead data channel (peer
   unreachable, but no `on_close`/`on_error` and ICE still nominally
   `Connected`) fires no event. The only backstop is the heartbeat, and
   its effective stale cutoff is `HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MS +
   WAKE_DETECTION_THRESHOLD_MS` ≈ **90 s**. ICE-disconnect itself is
   noticed fast (callback-driven), but the ICE watchdog re-drives on a
   **3 s** poll (`ICE_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`).

This document is **Phase 0 + 1** of the cleanup: *make it observable,
then reproduce it deterministically*. We do not change the ladder or its
constants here — we instrument the engine so every fix afterward is
driven by data, not by guesswork. You cannot fix a distributed timing
bug by eyeballing three plain-text logs you can't line up.

## What this adds

| Tool | What it gives you |
|------|-------------------|
| `myownmesh ctl trace <network>` | A live JSONL stream of every per-peer connection-state transition. The primary, machine-parseable artifact. |
| `MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE=1` | Forces the engine's tracer on even with no live `ctl trace` subscriber, so transitions land in the daemon log. |
| `MYOWNMESH_LOG_FORMAT=json` | Switches the daemon to structured JSON logs — the trace events appear as first-class keyed records alongside the surrounding ICE/signaling context. |
| `scripts/merge-traces.py` | Interleaves several machines' trace files into one wall-clock-ordered timeline. |

The tracer is **free when nobody is watching**: the driver loop checks
one atomic before doing any work, so leaving the code in place costs
nothing in production. It turns on the moment a `ctl trace` client
attaches or `MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE` is set.

### Anatomy of a `ConnTrace` record

```json
{
  "ts_wall_ms": 1750100003200,   // wall clock — cross-machine ordering (NTP-skewed)
  "t_mono_ms": 3205,             // ms since this driver started — monotonic, authoritative within one machine
  "network_id": "home",
  "device_id": "3f9a2c1b9988…",
  "epoch": 1,                    // bumps on every session rebuild — flap detector
  "changed": ["ice"],            // which discrete fields moved since the last record for this peer
  "status": "active",            // engine app-level status
  "tier": "steady",              // reconnection-ladder tier
  "ice_state": "Disconnected",   // raw RTCIceConnectionState
  "pc_state": "Connected",       // raw RTCPeerConnectionState
  "pair_class": "lan",           // how traffic flows once nominated: lan | stun | turn
  "rtt_ms": 4,                   // app-level ping/pong RTT
  "last_recv_age_ms": 3200,      // age of last inbound frame
  "authenticated": true,
  "local_shelved": false,
  "remote_shelved": false
}
```

A record is emitted only when one of the **discrete** fields changes
(`epoch`, `status`, `tier`, `ice`, `pc`, `pair`, `auth`,
`local_shelved`, `remote_shelved`). The continuously-varying values
(`rtt_ms`, `last_recv_age_ms`) ride along as context but don't by
themselves trigger a record. `changed` names exactly what moved, plus
the lifetime markers `appeared` / `vanished`.

**The signatures to look for:**

- `status=active` with `ice_state=Disconnected` (or `pc_state` lagging)
  → the **source-of-truth drift**. The engine still thinks the peer is
  live; ICE doesn't. Look at how long it persists before something
  reconciles it.
- **`epoch` climbing** for a peer that looks otherwise stable →
  connection **flapping**: it's being torn down and rebuilt under you.
- `pair_class=turn` (or `stun`) where you expected `lan` → traffic is
  relaying/holepunching when a direct path should exist.
- A long gap in `t_mono_ms` between records, or a `{"lagged":N}` marker
  in the stream → the process was paused (sleep) or a transition storm
  outran the reader.

## Capturing a session

Run the daemon and, in a second shell, the trace, on **each** machine.
Tag the file with the hostname so the merge tool can label rows.

> **Running the GUI (`just dev`)?** The GUI auto-spawns the daemon and
> forwards its logs to your terminal — **except on Windows**, where the
> GUI is a windowless process with no console for the daemon's stdout to
> inherit, so you see nothing. On every OS the robust path is to run the
> daemon **standalone** and let the GUI attach to it: `just serve-trace`
> in one terminal (full logs + the connection tracer, on Windows too),
> and — if you want the GUI — `just dev` in another. The GUI probes the
> control socket, finds the running daemon, and attaches instead of
> spawning its own. (`just serve-trace` is just the daemon with
> `MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE=1` and a connection-debugging log filter.)

> **Log filter — use `MYOWNMESH_LOG_EXTRA`, not `MYOWNMESH_LOG`.** Setting
> `MYOWNMESH_LOG` *replaces* the default filter, which is what keeps the
> `webrtc-rs` sibling crates pinned to `error` — drop it and you get a
> firehose of per-candidate `pingAllCandidates` / `could not listen udp …`
> noise. `MYOWNMESH_LOG_EXTRA` instead *appends* to the default, so you
> bump our crates to debug while the webrtc quieting stays in place. (Use
> `MYOWNMESH_LOG` only when you deliberately want raw webrtc detail, e.g.
> `MYOWNMESH_LOG="info,webrtc_ice=debug"`.)

> **Where the negotiation stage lines went.** `create_offer` /
> `create_answer` / `set_remote_description` / `ensure_peer_session`, and the
> signaling relay's per-client `connected` / `disconnected` pair, are **debug**
> level. They used to be INFO on the reasoning that they fire once per connect
> attempt — fine when connects are rare, but a mesh that is renegotiating is
> exactly the one that floods, so the daemon logged hardest precisely when it
> was sickest (a field box reached a multi-gigabyte syslog this way, and a full
> disk takes the diagnosis with it). The default log is now boring on purpose.
>
> The debugging workflow is unchanged — the `MYOWNMESH_LOG_EXTRA` line below,
> and `just serve-trace`, already set `myownmesh_core=debug` and
> `myownmesh_signaling=debug`, which restore every one of those lines verbatim.

**macOS / Linux**

```sh
# shell 1 — daemon (verbose OUR-crate logs; webrtc stays quiet)
MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE=1 MYOWNMESH_LOG_EXTRA="myownmesh=debug,myownmesh_core=debug,myownmesh_signaling=debug" myownmesh serve

# shell 2 — connection trace to a per-host file
myownmesh ctl trace home > "trace-$(hostname -s).jsonl"
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
# shell 1 — daemon
$env:MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE = "1"; $env:MYOWNMESH_LOG_EXTRA = "myownmesh=debug,myownmesh_core=debug,myownmesh_signaling=debug"; myownmesh serve

# shell 2 — connection trace
myownmesh ctl trace home > "trace-$env:COMPUTERNAME.jsonl"
```

(`just serve-trace` sets exactly these for you.)

### Measuring establishment latency (real machines only)

`silent_area_scale` is a same-process functional control.  Its `LocalBroker`
and loopback ICE deliberately remove the network, so its timing must not be
reported as field connection latency.

For timing, run production daemons on two different machines.  Join the same
fresh Silent network on both, enable `auto_approve` for the unattended test,
and configure the signaling/STUN/TURN policy being evaluated.  Then run this on
the dialing machine (repeat `--network` with a different fresh network for each
sample):

```sh
python3 scripts/benchmark-connections.py \
  --binary ./target/release/myownmesh \
  --peer-host remote-hostname \
  --peer REMOTE_DEVICE_ID \
  --peer-binary-sha256 REMOTE_NATIVE_EXECUTABLE_SHA256 \
  --local-source-revision EXACT_GIT_REVISION \
  --peer-source-revision EXACT_SAME_GIT_REVISION \
  --scenario baseline \
  --network connection-bench-001 \
  --network connection-bench-002
```

The harness refuses a same-host peer label, duplicate network samples, and any
peer that was already admitted/approved or already had an ICE pair before the
dial. It requires both daemons to come from the same exact source revision and
records each native executable's SHA-256 independently (cross-platform native
artifacts need not be byte-identical). It consumes the daemon's exact
`{"peers": [...]}` response shape rather than a test-only API. It
times the public waited `connect_peer` operation, then requires the public peer
snapshot to show all of the following before accepting a sample:

- authenticated `active`/`shelved` state;
- local and remote approval observed;
- a nominated ICE pair classifiable as LAN, STUN, or TURN.

It prints one JSONL record for every attempt, including failures, plus success
rate, nearest-rank p50/p95/max/mean, connection-phase serial capacity, observed
whole-run attempt rate, executable SHA-256, host, OS, CPU count, and route
counts. Discovery is reported separately from
establishment. Use `--scenario semantic-admission-load` for a separately
controlled loaded run and record the load generator/rate with the artifact;
never mix baseline and loaded samples in one summary. Capture `ctl trace` on
both machines at the same time when stage attribution or cross-side confirmation
is required. Fewer than 20 successful attempts (the minimum that leaves one
whole observation in a nearest-rank p95 upper tail) or any failed attempt marks
the summary statistically unqualified instead of hiding that limitation. A
network that already has a live session is not a sample:
`connect_peer` is intentionally idempotent, so every `--network` must be fresh.

If you'd rather not keep a `ctl trace` shell open, set
`MYOWNMESH_CONN_TRACE=1` on the daemon and the transitions land in the
daemon log itself; with `MYOWNMESH_LOG_FORMAT=json` they're structured.
The dedicated `ctl trace` file is cleaner for the merge tool, though.

### Merge into one timeline

Pull the per-host files onto one box and:

```sh
scripts/merge-traces.py --skew trace-*.jsonl
```

```
TIME          +ms    HOST   PEER      EPOCH  CHANGED   STATUS  TIER          ICE           PC            PAIR  RTT  AGE
------------  -----  -----  --------  -----  --------  ------  ------------  ------------  ------------  ----  ---  ----
18:53:20.000  +0     mac    3f9a2c1b  1      appeared  active  steady        Connected     Connected     lan   4    120
18:53:21.000  +1000  linux  aa11bb22  7      appeared  active  steady        Connected     Connected     stun  30   50
18:53:23.200  +3200  mac    3f9a2c1b  1      ice       active  steady        Disconnected  Connected     -     4    3200
18:53:23.250  +3250  linux  aa11bb22  7      tier      active  ice_watchdog  Disconnected  Disconnected  stun  31   3300
```

That row at `+3200` — `status=active`, `ice=Disconnected` — is the
drift, caught the instant it happens. Filter to one peer with `--peer
3f9a2c1b`, one network with `--network home`, or a window with `--since
2026-06-16T20:00:00Z`. `--skew` prints each host's wall-clock span so
gross NTP offsets are obvious (sync the boxes with NTP before a run to
keep cross-machine ordering trustworthy; within a machine, `t_mono_ms`
is always correct regardless of skew).

---

## Reproduction scenarios (Phase 1)

The point of three machines is to trigger the real failure modes on
demand and watch them in the merged timeline. Start a capture on every
machine, run a scenario, stop the captures, merge. Keep a short note of
wall-clock-when-you-did-X so you can find it in the timeline.

The transport has no fault-injection seam today (it's a concrete
`webrtc-rs` wrapper, not a trait — an in-process shim is a deliberate
follow-up, see below), so these are **real OS faults on real machines** —
which is exactly the setup you have.

### 1. Baseline connect

Just bring all three up on the same network and let them reach `active`.
Confirm the healthy steady state: every peer `status=active`,
`tier=steady`, `ice=Connected`, stable `epoch`, and a `pair_class` that
matches your topology (`lan` on a LAN, `stun`/`turn` across NAT). This is
your control — know what good looks like before you break things.

### 2. Sleep / wake

The classic killer: heartbeats pause, the OS suspends timers, the
network drops for a beat on resume. Watch for the wake probe (Tier 2),
ICE restarts, and how fast peers return to `active` vs. the 90 s
heartbeat backstop.

- **macOS:** `sudo pmset relative wake 30 && pmset sleepnow` (sleep now,
  auto-wake in 30 s), or just close the lid.
- **Linux:** `sudo rtcwake -m mem -s 30` (suspend to RAM, wake in 30 s).
- **Windows:** `rundll32.exe powrprof.dll,SetSuspendState 0,1,0`, or use
  Sysinternals `psshutdown -d -t 0`.

In the timeline: expect a `t_mono_ms` jump across the sleep, then a
burst of `ice`/`tier`/`epoch` changes as the ladder recovers. A peer
stuck non-`active` long after the others recovered is a bug to chase.

### 3. Network handoff (Wi-Fi ↔ hotspot / interface flip)

Recovering a network change in place is what the ICE-restart and
network-watch machinery exists for. Flip the primary interface and watch
for the `restart_ice` path and `pair_class` changes (a handoff may move
you LAN→STUN→TURN).

- **macOS:** `networksetup -setairportpower en0 off` then `on`; or toggle
  Wi-Fi while tethered to keep a second path.
- **Linux:** `nmcli radio wifi off && sleep 5 && nmcli radio wifi on`, or
  `sudo ip link set <iface> down/up`.
- **Windows:** `netsh interface set interface "Wi-Fi" admin=disabled`
  then `enabled`.

### 4. Relay / signaling loss

If you host signaling (`ctl services enable signaling`), kill it and
watch peers fall back. Even on public Nostr you can block it at the
firewall to simulate a relay blackout. Look for the forced relay redial,
the buffered offers replaying on reconnect, and peers rebuilding via
discovery once signaling is back.

```sh
# on the signaling host
myownmesh ctl services disable signaling   # then re-enable after a minute
```

### 5. Hard link drop (the half-dead case)

Pull the ethernet cable or `down` the interface *without* a clean
shutdown — this is the case with no `on_close` event. This is where the
~90 s blind spot bites: note how long the timeline shows `status=active`
with a stale `last_recv_age_ms` before anything reacts. That latency is
the headline number Phase 3 is meant to cut (via a passive
`get_stats()` liveness signal).

---

## What this phase deliberately does **not** do

Per the "measure first, change what the data proves" decision, this is
instrumentation and reproduction only — no behavior change. The fixes
the traces are meant to justify are the next phases:

- **One derived connection state behind a single transition function**,
  replacing the several drifting fields (this is what kills the
  `status≠ice` class of bug at the root).
- **A passive `get_stats()` liveness/consent signal** on the ICE poll
  the engine already runs — closing the 3 s→90 s half-dead gap and
  letting the blanket heartbeat become conditional (less polling).
- **OS-native network-change and sleep/wake hooks** (netlink /
  `nw_path_monitor` / Windows power events) replacing the 3 s IP poll
  and tick-gap inference.
- **An in-process fault-injection harness**, which needs a transport
  trait seam to wrap — a larger, separate change than this additive
  observability layer.

When a captured timeline shows one of these clearly, that's the trace
that justifies making the change.
